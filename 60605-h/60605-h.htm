<h2>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE</h2>

<p>I undertook the translation of Dr. Rambousek’s book because
it seemed to me to treat the subject of industrial poisons in
as novel, comprehensive, and systematic a manner as was
possible within the compass of a single volume. Having
learnt much myself from Continental writings on industrial
diseases and factory hygiene, I was anxious to let others also
see how wide a field they had covered and how thorough
were the regulations for dangerous trades abroad, especially
in Germany. A praiseworthy feature of Dr. Rambousek’s
book was the wealth of references to the work of foreign
writers which is made on almost every page. To have left
these names and references, however, in the text as he has
done would have made the translation tedious reading, and
therefore for the sake of those who desire to pursue inquiry
further I have adopted the course of collecting the great
majority and placing them all together in an appendix at
the end of the volume.</p>

<p>Dr. Rambousek as a medical man, a chemist, and
a government official having control of industrial matters,
is equipped with the very special knowledge required to
describe the manufacturing processes giving rise to injurious
effects, the pathology of the lesions set up, and the preventive
measures necessary to combat them. In his references to
work done in this country he has relied largely on abstracts
which have appeared in medical and technical journals published
on the Continent. I have only thought it necessary
to amplify his statements when important work carried out
here on industrial poisoning,—such as that on nickel carbonyl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and on ferro-silicon—had been insufficiently noted. Such
additions are introduced in square brackets or in footnotes.</p>

<p>In his preface Dr. Rambousek says ‘the book is intended
for all who are, or are obliged to be, or ought to be, interested
in industrial poisoning.’ No words could better describe the
scope of the book.</p>

<p>The work of translation would never have been begun
but for the assistance given me in Parts II and III by my
sister, Miss H. Edith Legge. To her, and to Mr. H. E.
Brothers, F.I.C., who has been to the trouble of reading the
proofs and correcting many mistakes which my technical
knowledge was insufficient to enable me to detect, my best
thanks are due.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Messrs. Davidson &amp; Co., Belfast, for
permission to use figs. 46 and 48; to Messrs. Locke, Lancaster
&amp; Co., Millwall, for fig. 27; to Mr. R. Jacobson, for
figs. 30, 33, 37, 38, and 43; to Messrs. Siebe, Gorman &amp; Co.,
for figs. 32, 39, and 40; to Messrs. Blackman &amp; Co. for fig. 47;
to Messrs. Matthews &amp; Yates for fig. 54; to H.M. Controller
of the Stationery Office for permission to reproduce figs. 52,
53, and 54, and the diagrams on p. 284; and lastly to my
publisher, for figs. 41, 42, 43, and 49, which are taken from
the book by Dr. K. W. Goadby and myself on ‘Lead
Poisoning and Lead Absorption.’</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The attempt to systematise from the scientific standpoint
the mass of material that has been collected about poisons
is a very heavy task, even for the toxicologist who desires to
treat his subject comprehensively. How much greater is the
difficulty of writing a systematic book on industrial poisoning
keeping practical application in the forefront!</p>

<p>Technical considerations which are decisive in the causation
and prevention of industrial poisoning are here of especial
moment, and must naturally influence classification of the
subject-matter when the object is to assist those concerned in
factory hygiene.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, I have divided the subject into
three parts. The arrangement of the first, which gives as
complete a statement as possible of the occurrence of industrial
poisoning, into industries and processes was determined on
technical grounds. The second, which amplifies the first,
attempts to summarise the pathology or symptoms of the
various forms of poisoning. The references to the literature
of the particular subjects—as exhaustive as I could make
them—will lighten further study. To these two parts, following
on knowledge of causation and symptoms, the third, in
which preventive measures are outlined, is linked.</p>

<p>The apparent drawback in use of the book is that one
form of poisoning has often to be referred to in three places.
But, I hope, this is more than counterbalanced by the completeness
of the scheme which results from the subdivision of
the subject.</p>

<p>The pathology of industrial poisoning necessitates frequent
repetition when describing the branches of industry giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
rise to the intoxication, as one and the same form can occur
in the most varied processes. The numerous instances of
actual cases of poisoning quoted must therefore be regarded
as conforming to the same pathological type. Similarly,
preventive measures require separate systematic treatment in
order to avoid constant repetition which would otherwise
obscure the general survey. Quite a number of means of
prevention apply equally to several industries in which the
same cause is at work. The success attained by thus simplifying
the issues is the greater because such common measures
are the easier to carry through and to supervise.</p>

<p>The method therefore has been adopted only after serious
reflection and has been directed mainly by practical considerations.</p>

<p>Recent cases which have either been reported or come to
the knowledge of the author have been given, with particulars
as exact as possible. Cases dating back some time have been
omitted intentionally so as to exclude everything which did
not correspond with the present conditions of industry and
trade. Historical facts only receive consideration in so far
as they are fundamentally important and necessary for the
sake of completeness.</p>

<p>The details given in Part I of actual instances will supply
material for fresh efforts, renewed investigation, and new points
of attack.</p>

<h1>INDUSTRIAL POISONING</h1>

<h2 id="PART_I">PART I<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>DESCRIPTION OF THE INDUSTRIES AND
PROCESSES ATTENDED WITH RISK
OF POISONING; INCIDENCE OF SUCH
POISONING</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="I_THE_CHEMICAL_INDUSTRY">I. THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY</h3>

<h4>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AS TO INCIDENCE OF INDUSTRIAL
POISONING</h4>

<p>The chemical industry offers naturally a wide field for the
occurrence of industrial poisoning. Daily contact with the
actual poisonous substances to be prepared, used, stored, and
despatched in large quantity gives opportunity for either
acute or chronic poisoning—in the former case from sudden
accidental entrance into the system of fairly large doses,
as the result of defective or careless manipulation, and, in the
latter, constant gradual absorption (often unsuspected) of
the poison in small amount.</p>

<p>The industry, however, can take credit for the way in
which incidence of industrial poisoning has been kept down
in view of the magnitude and variety of the risks which often
threaten. This is attributable to the comprehensive hygienic
measures enforced in large chemical works keeping abreast of
modern advance in technical knowledge. A section of this
book deals with the principles underlying these measures.
Nevertheless, despite all regulations, risk of poisoning cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
be wholly banished. Again and again accidents and illness
occur for which industrial poisoning is responsible. Wholly
to prevent this is as impossible as entirely to prevent accidents
by mechanical guarding of machinery.</p>

<p>Owing to the unknown sources of danger, successful
measures to ward it off are often difficult. The rapid advance
of this branch of industry, the constant development of new
processes and reactions, the frequent discovery of new materials
(with properties at first unknown, and for a long time insufficiently
understood, but nevertheless indispensable), constantly
give rise to new dangers and possibilities of danger, of which
an accident or some disease with hitherto unknown symptoms
is the first indication. Further, even when the dangerous
effects are recognised, there may often be difficulty in devising
appropriate precautions, as circumstances may prevent immediate
recognition of the action of the poison. We cannot
always tell, for instance, with the substances used or produced
in the processes, which is responsible for the poisoning, because,
not infrequently, the substances in question are not chemically
pure, but may be either raw products, bye-products, &amp;c.,
producing mixtures of different bodies or liberating different
chemical compounds as impurities.</p>

<p>Hence difficulty often arises in the strict scientific explanation
of particular cases of poisoning, and, in a text-book such
as this, difficulty also of description. A rather full treatment
of the technical processes may make the task easier and help
to give a connected picture of the risks of poisoning in the
chemical industry. Such a procedure may be especially
useful to readers insufficiently acquainted with chemical
technology.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Leymann<a href="#endnote1" id="endnote-ref1"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> and Grandhomme<a href="#endnote2" id="endnote-ref2"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> especially
for knowledge of incidence of industrial poisoning in
this industry. The statistical data furnished by them are the
most important proof that poisoning, at any rate in large
factories, is not of very frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>Leymann’s statistics relate to a large modern works in
which the number employed during the twenty-three years of
observation increased from 640 in the year 1891 to 1562 in
1904, giving an average of about 1000 yearly, one-half of whom
might properly be defined as ‘chemical workers.’ The factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
is concerned in the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric
acids, alkali, bichromates, aniline, trinitro-phenol,
bleaching powder, organic chlorine compounds, and potassium
permanganate.</p>

<p>These statistics are usefully complemented by those of
Grandhomme drawn from the colour works at Höchst a-M.
This large aniline works employs from 2600 to 2700 workers;
the raw materials are principally benzene and its homologues,
naphthalene and anthracene. The manufacture includes the
production of coal-tar colours, nitro- and dinitro-benzene,
aniline, rosaniline, fuchsine, and other aniline colours, and
finally such pharmaceutical preparations as antipyrin, dermatol,
sanoform, &amp;c. Of the 2700 employed, 1400 are chemical
workers and the remainder labourers.</p>

<p>These two series of statistics based on exact observations
and covering allied chemical manufacture are taken together.
They seek to give the answer to the question—How many and
what industrial poisonings are found?</p>

<p>The figures of Leymann (on an average of 1000 workers
employed per annum) show 285 cases of poisoning reported
between the years 1881 and 1904. Of these 275 were caused
by aniline, toluidine, nitro- and dinitro-benzene, nitrophenol,
nitrochloro and dinitrochloro benzene. Three were fatal and
several involved lengthy invalidity (from 30 to 134 days, owing
to secondary pneumonia). Included further are one severe
case of chrome (bichromate) poisoning (with nephritis as a
sequela), five cases of lead poisoning, three of chlorine, and one
of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. In the Höchst a-M. factory
(employing about 2500 workers) there were, in the ten years
1883-92, only 129 cases of poisoning, of which 109 were
due to aniline. Later figures for the years 1893-5 showed
122 cases, of which 43 were due to aniline and 76 to lead
(contracted mostly in the nitrating house). Grandhomme
mentions further hyperidrosis among persons employed on
solutions of calcium chloride, injury to health from inhalation
of methyl iodide vapour in the antipyrin department, a fatal
case of benzene poisoning (entering an empty vessel in which
materials had previously been extracted with benzene), and
finally ulceration and perforation of the septum of the nose
in several chrome workers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of severe cases is not large, but it must be
remembered that the factories to which the figures relate are
in every respect models of their kind, amply provided with
safety appliances and arrangements for the welfare of the
workers. The relatively small amount of poisoning is to be
attributed without doubt to the precautionary measures taken.
Further, in the statistics referred to only those cases are
included in which the symptoms were definite, or so severe as
to necessitate medical treatment. Absorption of the poison
in small amount without producing characteristic symptoms,
as is often the case with irritating or corrosive fumes, and such
as involve only temporary indisposition, are not included.
Leymann himself refers to this when dealing with illness
observed in the mineral acid department (especially sulphuric
acid), and calls attention to the frequency of affections of the
respiratory organs among the persons employed, attributing
them rightly to the irritating and corrosive effect of the acid
vapour. Elsewhere he refers to the frequency of digestive
disturbance among persons coming into contact with sodium
sulphide, and thinks that this may be due to the action of
sulphuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the effect of industrial poisons on the health
of workers in chemical factories ought on no account to be
made light of. The admirable results cited are due to a proper
recognition of the danger, with consequent care to guard
against it. Not only have Grandhomme and Leymann<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
rendered great services by their work, but the firms in question
also, by allowing such full and careful inquiries to be undertaken
and published.</p>

<h4>SULPHURIC ACID (SULPHUR DIOXIDE)</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Manufacture.</span>—Sulphur dioxide, generally obtained by
roasting pyrites in furnaces of various constructions, or, more
rarely, by burning brimstone or sulphur from the spent oxide
of gas-works, serves as the raw material for the manufacture
of sulphuric acid. Before roasting the pyrites is crushed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
‘lump ore’ then separated from the ‘smalls,’ the former
roasted in ‘lump-burners’ or kilns (generally several roasting
furnace hearths united into one system), and the latter
preferably in Malétra and Malétra-Schaffner shelf-burners
(<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) composed of several superimposed firebrick shelves.
The pyrites is charged on to the uppermost shelf and gradually
worked downwards. Pyrites residues are not suitable for direct
recovery of iron, but copper can be recovered from residues
sufficiently rich in metal by the wet process; the residues
thus freed of copper and sulphur are then smelted for
recovery of iron.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—Pyrites Burner for Smalls (<i>after Lueger</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>Utilisation for sulphuric acid manufacture of the sulphur
dioxide given off in the calcining of zinc blende (see Spelter
works), impracticable in reverberatory furnaces, has been
made possible at the Rhenania factory by introduction of
muffle furnaces (several superimposed), because by this means
the gases led off are sufficiently concentrated, as they are not
diluted with the gases and smoke from the heating fires.
This method, like any other which utilises the gases from
roasting furnaces, has great hygienic, in addition to economical,
advantages, because escape of sulphur dioxide gas is avoided.
Furnace gases, too poor in sulphur dioxide to serve for direct
production of sulphuric acid, can with advantage be made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
produce liquid anhydrous sulphur dioxide. Thus, the sulphur
dioxide gas from the furnaces is first absorbed by water, driven
off again by boiling, cooled, dried, and liquefied by pressure.</p>

<p>The gaseous sulphur dioxide obtained by any of the
methods described is converted into sulphuric acid either by
(<i>a</i>) the chamber process or (<i>b</i>) the contact process.</p>

<p>In the <i>lead chamber process</i> the furnace gases pass through
flues in which the flue dust and a portion of the arsenious acid
are deposited into the Glover tower at a temperature of about
300° C., and from there into the lead chambers where oxidation
of the sulphur dioxide into sulphuric acid takes place, in the
presence of sufficient water, by transference of the oxygen of
the air through the intervention of the oxides of nitrogen.
The gases containing oxides of nitrogen, &amp;c., which are drawn
out of the lead chambers, have the nitrous fumes absorbed in
the Gay-Lussac tower (of which there are one or two in series),
by passage through sulphuric acid which is made to trickle
down the tower. The sulphuric acid so obtained, rich in
oxides of nitrogen, and the chamber acid are led to the Glover
tower for the purpose of denitration and concentration, so
that all the sulphuric acid leaves the Glover as Glover acid of
about 136-144° Tw. Losses in nitrous fumes are best made
up by addition of nitric acid at the Glover or introduction
into the first chamber. The deficiency is also frequently made
good from nitre-pots.</p>

<p>The lead chambers (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>) are usually constructed entirely—sides,
roof, and floor—of lead sheets, which are joined together
by means of a hydrogen blowpipe. The sheets forming the
roof and walls are supported, independent of the bottom, on
a framework of wood. The capacity varies from 35,000 to
80,000 cubic feet. The floor forms a flat collecting surface for
the chamber acid which lutes the chamber from the outer air.
The necessary water is introduced into the chamber as steam
or fine water spray.</p>

<p>The Glover and Gay-Lussac towers are lead towers. The
Glover is lined with acid-proof bricks and filled with acid-proof
packing to increase the amount of contact. The Gay-Lussac
is filled with coke over which the concentrated sulphuric
acid referred to above flows, forming, after absorption
of the nitrous fumes, nitro-sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>As already stated, two Gay-Lussac towers are usually
connected together, or where there are several lead-chamber
systems there is, apart from the Gay-Lussac attached to each,
a central Gay-Lussac in addition, common to the whole series.
The introduction of several Gay-Lussac towers has the advantage
of preventing loss of the nitrous fumes as much as possible—mainly
on economical grounds, as nitric acid is expensive.
But this arrangement is at the same time advantageous on
hygienic grounds, as escape of poisonous gases containing
nitrous fumes, &amp;c., is effectually avoided. The acids are
driven to the top of the towers by compressed air. The whole
system—chambers and towers—is connected by means of
wide lead conduits. Frequently, for the purpose of quickening
the chamber process (by increasing the number of condensing
surfaces) Lunge-Rohrmann plate towers are inserted in the
system—tall towers lined with lead in which square perforated
plates are hung horizontally, and down which diluted sulphuric
acid trickles.</p>

<p>To increase the draught in the whole system a chimney is
usual at the end, and, in addition, a fan of hard lead or earthenware
may be introduced in front of the first chamber or
between the two Gay-Lussac towers. Maintenance of a
constant uniform draught is not only necessary for technical
reasons, but has hygienic interest, since escape of injurious
gases is avoided (see also Part III).</p>

<p>The chamber acid (of 110°-120° Tw. = 63-70 %) and the
stronger Glover acid (of 136°-144° Tw. = 75-82 %) contain
impurities. In order to obtain for certain purposes pure
strong acid the chamber acid is purified and concentrated.
The impurities are notably arsenious and nitrous acids (Glover
acid is N free), lead, copper, and iron. Concentration (apart
from that to Glover acid in the Glover tower) is effected by
evaporation in lead pans to 140° Tw. and finally in glass balloons
or platinum stills to 168° Tw. (= 97 %). The lead pans are
generally heated by utilising the waste heat from the furnaces
or by steam coils in the acid itself, or even by direct firing.</p>

<p>Production of sulphuric acid by the <i>contact method</i> depends
on the fact that a mixture of sulphur dioxide and excess of
oxygen (air) combines to form sulphur trioxide at a moderate heat
in presence of a contact substance such as platinised asbestos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
or oxide of iron. The sulphur dioxide must be carefully
cleaned and dried, and with the excess of air is passed through
the contact substance. If asbestos carrying a small percentage
of finely divided platinum is the contact substance, it is
generally used in the form of pipes; oxide of iron (the residue
of pyrites), if used, is charged into a furnace. Cooling by a
coil of pipes and condensation in washing towers supplied with
concentrated sulphuric acid always forms a part of the process.
A fan draws the gases from the roasting furnaces and drives
them through the system. The end product is a fuming
sulphuric acid containing 20-30 per cent. SO₃. From this by
distillation a concentrated acid and a pure anhydride are
obtained. From a health point of view it is of importance
to know that all sulphuric acid derived from this anhydride
is pure and free from arsenic.</p>

<p>The most important <i>uses</i> of sulphuric acid are the following:
as chamber acid (110°-120° Tw.) in the superphosphate,
ammonium sulphate, and alum industries; as Glover acid
(140°-150° Tw.) in the Leblanc process, i.e. saltcake and
manufacture of hydrochloric acid, and to etch metals; as
sulphuric acid of 168° Tw. in colour and explosives manufacture
(nitric acid, nitro-benzene, nitro-glycerine, gun-cotton,
&amp;c.); as concentrated sulphuric acid and anhydride for the
production of organic sulphonic acids (for the alizarin and
naphthol industry) and in the refining of petroleum and
other oils. Completely de-arsenicated sulphuric acid is used
in making starch, sugar, pharmaceutical preparations, and
in electrical accumulator manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—The health of sulphuric acid workers
cannot in general be described as unfavourable.</p>

<p>In comparison with chemical workers they have, it is said,
relatively the lowest morbidity. Although in this industrial
occupation no special factors are at work which injure in
general the health of the workers, there is a characteristic
effect, without doubt due to the occupation—namely, disease
of the respiratory organs. Leymann’s figures are sufficiently
large to show that the number of cases of diseases of the
respiratory organs is decidedly greater in the sulphuric acid
industry than among other chemical workers. He attributes
this to the irritating and corrosive effect of sulphur dioxide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and sulphuric acid vapour on the mucous membrane of the
respiratory tract, as inhalation of these gases can never be
quite avoided, because the draught in the furnace and chamber
system varies, and the working is not always uniform.
Strongly irritating vapours escape again in making a high
percentage acid in platinum vessels, which in consequence
are difficult to keep air-tight. Of greater importance than
these injurious effects from frequent inhalation of small
quantities of acid vapours, or employment in workrooms
in which the air is slightly charged with acid, is the accidental
sudden inhalation of large quantities of acid gases, which
may arise in the manufacture, especially by careless attendance.
Formerly this was common in charging the roasting furnaces
when the draught in the furnace, on addition of the pyrites,
was not strengthened at the same time. This can be easily
avoided by artificial regulation of the draught.</p>

<p>Accidents through inhalation of acid gases occur further
when entering the lead chambers or acid tanks, and in emptying
the towers. Heinzerling relates several cases taken from
factory inspectors’ reports. Thus, in a sulphuric acid factory
the deposit (lead oxysulphate) which had collected on the
floor of a chamber was being removed: to effect this the lead
chambers were opened at the side. Two of the workers, who
had probably been exposed too long to the acid vapours
evolved in stirring up the deposit, died a short time after they
had finished the work. A similar fatality occurred in cleaning
out a nitro-sulphuric acid tank, the required neutralisation
of the acid by lime before entering having been omitted. Of
the two workers who entered, one died the next day; the other
remained unaffected. The deceased had, as the post mortem
showed, already suffered previously from pleurisy. A fatality
from breathing nitrous fumes is described fully in the report
of the Union of Chemical Industry for the year 1905. The
worker was engaged with two others in fixing a fan to a lead
chamber; the workers omitted to wait for the arrival of the
foreman who was to have supervised the operation. Although
the men used moist sponges as respirators, one of them inhaled
nitrous fumes escaping from the chamber in such quantity
that he died the following day.</p>

<p>Similar accidents have occurred in cleaning out the Gay-Lussac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
towers. Such poisonings have repeatedly occurred
in Germany. Fatal poisoning is recorded in the report of
the Union of Chemical Industry, in the emptying and cleaning
of a Gay-Lussac tower despite careful precautions. The
tower, filled with coke, had been previously well washed with
water, and during the operation of emptying, air had been
constantly blown through by means of a Körting’s injector.
The affected worker had been in the tower about an hour;
two hours later symptoms of poisoning set in which proved
fatal in an hour despite immediate medical attention. As
such accidents kept on recurring, the Union of Chemical
Industry drew up special precautions to be adopted in the
emptying of these towers, which are printed in Part III.</p>

<p>Naturally, in all these cases it is difficult to say exactly
which of the acid gases arising in the production of sulphuric
acid was responsible for the poisoning. In the fatal cases
cited, probably nitrous fumes played the more important part.</p>

<p>Poisoning has occurred in the transport of sulphuric acid.
In some of the cases, at all events, gaseous impurities, especially
arseniuretted hydrogen, were present.</p>

<p>Thus, in the reports of the German Union of Chemical
Industry for the year 1901, a worker succumbed through
inhalation of poisonous gases in cleaning out a tank waggon
for the transport of sulphuric acid. The tank was cleaned of
the adhering mud, as had been the custom for years, by a
man who climbed into it. No injurious effects had been
noted previously at the work, and no further precautions were
taken than that one worker relieved another at short intervals,
and the work was carried on under supervision. On the
occasion in question, however, there was an unusually large
quantity of deposit, although the quality of the sulphuric
acid was the same, and work had to be continued longer.
The worker who remained longest in the tank became ill on his
way home and died in hospital the following day; the other
workers were only slightly affected. The sulphuric acid used
by the firm in question immediately before the accident came
from a newly built factory in which anhydrous sulphuric
acid had been prepared by a special process. The acid was
Glover acid, and it is possible that selenium and arsenic
compounds were present in the residues. Arseniuretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
hydrogen might have been generated in digging up the mud.
Two similar fatalities are described in the report of the same
Union for the year 1905. They happened similarly in cleaning
out a sulphuric acid tank waggon, and in them the arsenic in
the acid was the cause. Preliminary swilling out with water
diluted the remainder of the sulphuric acid, but, nevertheless,
it acted on the iron of the container. Generation of hydrogen
gas is the condition for the reduction of the arsenious acid
present in sulphuric acid with formation of arseniuretted
hydrogen. In portions of the viscera arsenic was found.
Lately in the annual reports of the Union of Chemical Industry
for 1908 several cases of poisoning are described which were
caused by sulphuric acid. A worker took a sample out of a
vessel of sulphuric acid containing sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
Instead of using the prescribed cock, he opened the man-hole
and put his head inside, inhaling concentrated sulphuretted
hydrogen gas. He became immediately unconscious and
died. Through ignorance no use was made of the oxygen
apparatus.</p>

<p>Another fatality occurred through a foreman directing
some workers, contrary to the regulations against accidents
from nitrous gases, to clean a vessel containing nitric and
sulphuric acids. They wore no air helmets: one died shortly
after from inhalation of nitrous fumes. Under certain circumstances
even the breaking of carboys filled with sulphuric acid
may give rise to severe poisoning through inhalation of acid
gases. Thus a fatality<a href="#endnote3" id="endnote-ref3"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> occurred to the occupier of a workroom
next some premises in which sulphuric acid carboys had been
accidentally broken. Severe symptoms developed the same
night, and he succumbed the next morning in spite of treatment
with oxygen. A worker in the factory became seriously
ill but recovered.</p>

<p>A similar case is described<a href="#endnote4" id="endnote-ref4"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> in a factory where concentrated
sulphuric acid had been spilt. The workers covered the spot
with shavings, which resulted in strong development of sulphur
dioxide, leading to unconsciousness in one worker.</p>

<p>The frequent observation of the injurious effect of acid
gases on the teeth of workers requires mention; inflammation
of the eyes of workers also is attributed to the effects of
sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Leymann’s statistics show <i>corrosions and burns</i> among
sulphuric acid workers to be more than five times that among
other classes. Such burns happen most frequently from
carelessness. Thus, in the reports of the Union of Chemical
Industry for 1901, three severe accidents are mentioned
which occurred from use of compressed air. In two cases the
acid had been introduced before the compressed air had been
turned off; in the third the worker let the compressed air
into the vessel and forgot to turn off the inlet valve. Although
the valves were provided with lead guards, some of the acid
squirted into the worker’s face. In one case complete blindness
followed, in a second blindness in one eye, and in the third
blindness in one eye and impaired vision of the other.</p>

<p>Besides these dangers from the raw material, bye-products,
and products of the manufacture, <i>lead poisoning</i> has been
reported in the erection and repair of lead chambers. The
lead burners generally use a hydrogen flame; the necessary
hydrogen is usually made from zinc and sulphuric acid and
is led to the iron by a tube. If the zinc and sulphuric acid
contain arsenic, the very dangerous arseniuretted hydrogen is
formed, which escapes through leakages in the piping, or is
burnt in the flame to arsenious acid.</p>

<p>Further, the lead burners and plumbers are exposed to the
danger of chronic lead poisoning from insufficient observance
of the personal precautionary measures necessary to guard
against it (see Part III). Those who are constantly engaged
in burning the lead sheets and pipes of the chambers suffer
not infrequently from severe symptoms. Unfortunately, the
work requires skill and experience, and hence alternation of
employment is hardly possible.</p>

<p>Finally, mention should be made of poisoning by <i>arseniuretted
hydrogen gas</i> from vessels filled with sulphuric acid containing
arsenic as an impurity, and by sulphuretted hydrogen
gas in purifying the acid itself. In the manufacture of liquid
<i>sulphur dioxide</i>, injury to health can arise from inhalation of
the acid escaping from the apparatus. The most frequent
cause for such escape of sulphur dioxide is erosion of the walls
of the compressor pumps and of the transport vessels, in
consequence of the gas being insufficiently dried, as, when
moist, it attacks iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Sulphur dioxide will come up for further consideration
when describing the industrial processes giving rise to it, or in
which it is used.</p>

<h4>HYDROCHLORIC ACID, SALTCAKE, AND SODA</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Manufacture.</span>—The production of hydrochloric acid
(HCl), sodium sulphate (Na₂SO₄), and sodium sulphide (Na₂S)
forms part of the manufacture of soda (Na₂CO₃) by the Leblanc
process. The products first named increase in importance,
while the Leblanc soda process is being replaced more and more
by the manufacture of soda by the Solvay ammonia process,
so much so that on the Continent the latter method predominates
and only in England does the Leblanc process hold
its ground.</p>

<p>Health interests have exercised an important bearing on
the development of the industries in question. At first, in the
Leblanc process the hydrochloric acid gas was allowed to
escape into the atmosphere, being regarded as a useless bye-product.
Its destructive action on plant life and the inconvenience
caused to the neighbourhood, in spite of erection of
high chimneys, demanded intervention. In England the evils
led to the enactment of the Alkali Acts—the oldest classical
legislative measures bearing on factory hygiene—by which the
Leblanc factories were required to condense the vapour by
means of its absorption in water, and this solution of the acid
is now a highly valued product. And, again, production of
nuisance—inconvenience to the neighbourhood through the
soda waste—was the main cause of ousting one of the oldest
and most generally used methods of chemical industrial production.
Although every effort was made to overcome the
difficulties, the old classical Leblanc process is gradually but
surely yielding place to the modern Solvay process, which
has no drawback on grounds of health.</p>

<p>We outline next the main features of the <i>Leblanc soda
process</i>, which includes, as has been mentioned, also the manufacture
of hydrochloric acid, sodium sulphate and sulphide.</p>

<p>The first part of the process consists in the production of the
sulphate from salt and sulphuric acid, during which hydrochloric
acid is formed; this is carried out in two stages
represented in the following formulæ:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. NaCl + H₂SO₄ = NaHSO₄ + HCl.</li>
<li>2. NaCl + NaHSO₄ = Na₂SO₄ + HCl.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first stage in which bisulphate is produced is carried
out at a moderate heat, the second requires a red heat. The
reactions, therefore, are made in a furnace combining a pan and
muffle furnace.</p>

<p>This saltcake muffle furnace is so arranged that the pan can
be shut off from the muffle by a sliding-door (D). The pan
(A) and muffle (E) have separate flues for carrying off the
hydrochloric acid developed (B, F). First, common salt is
treated with sulphuric (Glover) acid in the cast-iron pan. When
generation of hydrochloric acid vapour has ceased, the sliding-door
is raised and the partly decomposed mixture is pushed
through into the muffle, constructed of fire-resisting bricks and
tiles, and surrounded by the fire gases. While the muffle is
being raised to red heat, the sulphate must be repeatedly
stirred with a rake in order, finally, while still hot and giving off
acid vapour, to be drawn out at the working doors into iron
boxes provided with doors, where the material cools. The acid
vapour given off when cooling is drawn through the top of the
box into the furnace.</p>

</div>

<p>Mechanical stirrers, despite their advantage from a health
point of view, have not answered because of their short life.</p>

<p>The valuable bye-product of the sulphate process, <i>hydrochloric
acid</i>, is led away separately from the pan and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
muffle, as is seen, into one absorption system. The reason of
the separation is that the gas from the pan is always the more
concentrated. The arrangement of the absorbing apparatus
is illustrated in <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The gases are led each through earthenware pipes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
channels of stone pickled with tar (A´), first into small towers
of Yorkshire flags (B), where they are cooled and freed from flue
dust and impurities (sulphuric acid) by washing. They are
next led through a series (over fifty) of Woulff bottles (bombonnes)
one metre high, made of acid-resisting stoneware.
The series is laid with a slight inclination towards the furnace,
and water trickles through so that the gases coming from the
wash towers are brought into contact with water in the one
case already almost saturated, whilst the gas which is poorest
in hydrochloric acid meets with fresh water. From the bombonne
situated next to the wash tower the prepared acid is
passed as a rule through another series. The last traces of
hydrochloric acid are then removed by leading the gases from
the Woulff bottles up two water towers of stoneware (D and E),
which are filled partly with earthenware trays and partly with
coke; above are tanks from which the water trickles down over
the coke. The residual gases from both sets of absorbing
apparatus now unite in a large Woulff bottle before finally
being led away through a duct to the chimney stack.</p>

<p>Less frequently absorption of hydrochloric acid is effected
without use of Woulff bottles, principally in wash towers such
as the Lunge-Rohrmann plate tower.</p>

<p>In the purification of hydrochloric acid, de-arsenicating by
sulphuretted hydrogen or by barium sulphide, &amp;c., and separation
of sulphuric acid by addition of barium chloride, have to be
considered.</p>

<p>Another method for production of sulphate and hydrochloric
acid, namely, the Hargreaves process, is referred to later.</p>

<p>We return now to the further working up of the sodium
sulphate into sulphide and soda. The conversion of the
sulphate into soda by the Leblanc method is effected by
heating with coal and calcium carbonate, whereby, through the
action of the coal, sodium sulphide forms first, which next
with the calcium carbonate becomes converted into sodium
carbonate and calcium sulphide.</p>

<p>The reactions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Na₂SO₄ + 2C = Na₂S + 2CO₂</li>
<li>Na₂S + CaCO₃ = Na₂CO₃ + CaS</li>
<li>CaCO₃ + C = CaO + 2CO.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The reactions are carried out in small works in open
reverberatory furnaces having two platforms on the hearth, and
with continuous raking from one to the other which, as the
equations show, cause escape of carbonic
acid gas and carbonic oxide.</p>

<p>Such handworked furnaces, apart
from their drawbacks on health
grounds, have only a small capacity,
and in large works their place is
taken by revolving furnaces—closed,
movable cylindrical furnaces—in which
handwork is replaced by the mechanical
revolution of the furnace and from
which a considerably larger output
and a product throughout good in
quality are obtained.</p>

<p>The <i>raw soda</i> thus obtained in
the black ash furnace is subjected to
lixiviation by water in iron tanks in
which the impurities or tank waste
(see below) are deposited. The crude
soda liquor so obtained is then further
treated and converted into calcined
soda, crystal soda, or caustic soda.
In the production of calcined soda
the crude soda liquor is first purified
(‘oxidised’ and ‘carbonised’) by
blowing through air and carbonic acid
gas, pressed through a filter press, and
crystallised by evaporation in pans
and calcined, i.e. deprived of water by
heat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="fig5">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>—Revolving Black Ash Furnace—Elevation (<i>after Lueger</i>)</p>

<p class="caption">A Firing hearth; B Furnace; C Dust box.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Crystal soda</i> is obtained from well-purified
tank liquor by crystallising in
cast-iron vessels.</p>

<p>Caustic soda is obtained by introducing lime suspended in
iron cages into the soda liquor in iron caustic pots, heating with
steam, and agitating by blowing in air.</p>

<p>The resulting clear solution is drawn off and evaporated in
cast-iron pans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>As already mentioned, the <i>tank waste</i> in the Leblanc process,
which remains behind—in amount about equal to the soda
produced after lixiviation of the raw soda with water—constitutes
a great nuisance. It forms mountains round the
factories, and as it consists principally of calcium sulphide
and calcium carbonate, it easily weathers under the influence
of air and rain, forming soluble sulphur compounds and
developing sulphuretted hydrogen gas—an intolerable source
of annoyance to the district.</p>

<p>At the same time all the sulphur introduced into the
industry as sulphuric acid is lost in the tank waste. This loss
of valuable material and the nuisance created led to attempts—partially
successful—to recover the sulphur.</p>

<p>The best results are obtained by the Chance-Claus method,
in which the firebrick ‘Claus-kiln’ containing ferric oxide
(previously heated to dull redness) is used. In this process
calcium sulphide is acted on by carbonic acid with evolution of
gas so rich in sulphuretted hydrogen that it can be burnt to
sulphur dioxide and used in the lead chambers for making sulphuric
acid. Sulphur also as such is obtained by the method.</p>

<p>These sulphur-recovery processes which have hardly been
tried on the Continent—only the United Alkali Company in
England employs the Chance-Claus on a large scale—were, as
has been said, not in a position to prevent the downfall of the
Leblanc soda industry. Before describing briefly the Solvay
method a word is needed as to other processes for manufacture
of sulphate and hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><i>Hargreaves’ process</i> produces sodium sulphate (without
previous conversion of sulphur dioxide into sulphuric acid)
directly by the passage of gases from the pyrites burners, air
and steam, through salt blocks placed in vertical cast-iron
retorts, a number of which are connected in series. A fan draws
the gases through the system and leads the hydrochloric acid
fumes to the condenser.</p>

<p>Sodium sulphate is used in the manufacture of glass,
ultramarine, &amp;c. Further, the sulphate is converted into
Glauber’s salts by dissolving the anhydrous sulphate obtained
in the muffle furnace, purifying with lime, and allowing the
clear salt solution to crystallise out in pans.</p>

<p>A further use of the sulphate is the preparation of sodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sulphide, which is effected (as in the first part of the Leblanc
soda process) by melting together sulphate and coal in a
reverberatory furnace. If the acid sulphate (bisulphate) or
sulphate containing bisulphate is used much sulphur dioxide
gas comes off.</p>

<p>The mass is then lixiviated in the usual soda liquor vats
and the lye either treated so as to obtain crystals or evaporated
to strong sodium sulphide which is poured like caustic soda
into metal drums where it solidifies.</p>

<p>In <i>Solvay’s ammonia soda process</i> ammonia recovered from
the waste produced in the industry is led into a solution of
salt until saturation is complete. This is effected generally in
column apparatus such as is used in distillation of spirit. The
solution is then driven automatically by compressed air to
the carbonising apparatus in which the solution is saturated
with carbonic acid; this apparatus is a cylindrical tower
somewhat similar to the series of vessels used for saturating
purposes in sugar factories through which carbonic acid gas
passes. In this process crystalline bi-carbonate of soda is
first formed, which is separated from the ammoniacal mother
liquor by filtration, centrifugalisation, and washing. The
carbonate is then obtained by heating (calcining in pans),
during which carbonic acid gas escapes, and this, together
with the carbonic acid produced in the lime kilns, is utilised
for further carbonisation again. The lime formed during
the production of carbonic acid in the lime kilns serves to drive
the ammonia out of the ammoniacal mother liquor, so that the
ammonia necessary for the process is recovered and used over
and over again. The waste which results from the action of
the lime on the ammonium chloride liquor is harmless—calcium
chloride liquor.</p>

<p>The <i>electrolytic</i> manufacture of soda from salt requires
mention, in which chlorine (at the anode) and caustic soda
(at the cathode) are formed; the latter is treated with carbonic
acid to make soda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Leymann’s observations show that
in the department concerned with the Leblanc soda process
and production of sodium sulphide, relatively more sickness
is noted than, for example, in the manufacture of sulphuric
and nitric acids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>In the preparation of the sulphate, possibility of injury to
health or poisoning arises from the fumes containing hydrochloric
or sulphuric acid in operations at the muffle furnace;
in Hargreaves’ process there may be exposure to the effect
of sulphur dioxide. Hydrochloric and sulphuric acid vapours
can escape from the muffle furnace when charging, from
leakages in it, and especially when withdrawing the still hot
sulphate. Large quantities of acid vapours escape from the
glowing mass, especially if coal is not added freely and if it
is not strongly calcined. Persons employed at the saltcake
furnaces suffer, according to Jurisch, apart from injury to
the lungs, from defective teeth. The teeth of English workers
especially, it is said, from the practice of holding flannel in
their mouths with the idea of protecting themselves from the
effect of the vapours, are almost entirely eroded by the action
of the hydrochloric acid absorbed by the saliva. Hydrochloric
acid vapour, further, can escape from the absorbing apparatus
if this is not kept entirely sealed, and the hydrochloric acid
altogether absorbed—a difficult matter. Nevertheless, definite
acute industrial poisoning from gaseous hydrochloric acid is
rare, no doubt because the workers do not inhale it in concentrated
form.</p>

<p>Injury to the skin from the acid absorbed in water may
occur in filling, unloading, and transport, especially when in
carboys, but the burns, if immediately washed, are very slight
in comparison with those from sulphuric or nitric acids.
Injury to health or inconvenience from sulphuretted hydrogen
is at all events possible in the de-arsenicating process by means
of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. At the saltcake furnace when
worked by hand the fumes containing carbonic oxide gas may
be troublesome. In the production of caustic soda severe
corrosive action on the skin is frequent. Leymann found that
13·8 per cent. of the persons employed in the caustic soda
department were reported as suffering from burns, and calls
attention to the fact that on introducing the lime into the hot
soda lye the contents of the vessel may easily froth over.
Heinzerling refers to the not infrequent occurrence of eye
injuries in the preparation of caustic soda, due to the spurting
of lye or of solid particles of caustic soda.</p>

<p>The tank waste gives rise, as already stated, to inconvenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
from the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen. In the recovery
of the sulphur and treatment of the tank waste, sulphuretted
hydrogen and sulphur dioxide gases are evolved. According
to Leymann, workers employed in removing the waste and
at the lye vats frequently suffer from inflammation of the
eyes. Further, disturbance of digestion has been noted in
persons treating the tank waste, which Leymann attributes
to the unavoidable development of sulphuretted hydrogen
gas.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of sodium sulphide similar conditions
prevail. Leymann found in this branch relatively more
cases of sickness than in any other; diseases of the digestive
tract especially appeared to be more numerous. Leymann
makes the suggestion that occurrence of disease of the digestive
organs is either favoured by sodium sulphide when swallowed
as dust, or that here again sulphuretted hydrogen gas plays a
part. Further corrosive effect on the skin and burns may
easily arise at work with the hot corrosive liquor.</p>

<p>In the Solvay ammonia process ammonia and carbonic acid
gas are present, but, so far as I know, neither injury to health
nor poisoning have been described among persons employed
in the process. Indeed, the view is unanimous that this method
of manufacture with its technical advantages has the merit
also of being quite harmless. As may be seen from the preceding
description of the process there is no chance of the
escape of the gases named into the workrooms.</p>

<h4>USE OF SULPHATE AND SULPHIDE</h4>

<p><i>Ultramarine</i> is made from a mixture of clay, sulphate
(Glauber’s salts), and carbon—sulphate ultramarine; or clay,
sulphur, and soda—soda ultramarine. These materials are
crushed, ground, and burnt in muffle furnaces. On heating
the mass in the furnace much sulphur dioxide escapes, which
is a source of detriment to the workmen and the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Sulphonal</i> (CH₃)₂C(SO₂C₂H₅)₂, diethylsulphone dimethylmethane,
used medically as a hypnotic, is obtained from
mercaptan formed by distillation of ethyl sulphuric acid with
sodium or potassium sulphide. The mercaptan is converted
into mercaptol, and this by oxidation with potassium permanganate
into sulphonal. The volatile mercaptan has a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
disgusting odour, and clings for a long time even to the clothes
of those merely passing through the room.</p>

<p><i>Diethyl sulphate</i> ((C₂H₅)₂SO₄).—Diethyl sulphate obtained
by the action of sulphuric acid on alcohol has led to poisoning
characterised by corrosive action on the respiratory tract.<a href="#endnote5" id="endnote-ref5"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> As
the substance in the presence of water splits up into sulphuric
acid and alcohol, this corrosive action is probably due to the
acid. It is possible, however, that the molecule of diethyl
sulphate as such has corrosive action.</p>

<p>Contact with diethyl sulphate is described as having led to
fatal poisoning.<a href="#endnote6" id="endnote-ref6"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> </p>

<p>A chemist when conducting a laboratory experiment
dropped a glass flask containing about 40 c.c. of diethyl
sulphate, thereby spilling some over his clothes. He went on
working, and noticed burns after some time, quickly followed
by hoarseness and pain in the throat. He died of severe inflammation
of the lungs. A worker in another factory was dropping
diethyl sulphate and stirring it into an at first solid, and later
semi-liquid, mass for the purpose of ethylating a dye stuff. In
doing so he was exposed to fumes, and at the end of the work
complained of hoarseness and smarting of the eyes. He died
of double pneumonia two days later. Post mortem very
severe corrosive action on the respiratory tract was found,
showing that the diethyl sulphuric acid had decomposed
inside the body and that nascent sulphuric acid had given
rise to the severe burns. The principal chemist who had
superintended the process suffered severely from hoarseness
at night, but no serious consequences followed.</p>

<p>It is stated also that workmen in chemical factories coming
into contact with the fumes of diethyl sulphate ester suffer
from eye affections.<a href="#endnote7" id="endnote-ref7"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> </p>

<h4>CHLORINE, CHLORIDE OF CALCIUM, AND CHLORATES</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Manufacture.</span>—The older processes depend on the preparation
of chlorine and hydrochloric acid by an oxidation
process in which the oxidising agent is either a compound rich
in oxygen—usually common manganese dioxide (pyrolusite)—or
the oxygen of the air in the presence of heated copper
chloride (as catalytic agent). The former (Weldon process)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
is less used now than either the latter (Deacon process) or the
electrolytic manufacture of chlorine.</p>

<p>In the <i>Weldon process</i> from the still liquors containing
manganous chloride the manganese peroxide is regenerated,
and this so regenerated Weldon mud, when mixed with fresh
manganese dioxide, is used to initiate the process. This is
carried out according to the equations:</p>

<ul>
<li>MnO₂ + 4HCl = MnCl₄ + 2H₂O</li>
<li>MnCl₄ = MnCl₂ + Cl₂.</li>
</ul>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="fig6">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>—Preparation of Chlorine—Diaphragm Method (<i>after Ost</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>Hydrochloric acid is first introduced into the chlorine still
(vessels about 3 m. in height, of Yorkshire flag or fireclay),
next the Weldon mud gradually, and finally steam to bring the
whole to boiling; chlorine comes off in a uniform stream.
The manganous chloride still liquor is run into settling tanks.
The regeneration of the manganous chloride liquor takes
place in an oxidiser which consists of a vertical iron cylinder
in which air is blown into the heated mixture of manganous
chloride and milk of lime. The dark precipitate so formed,
‘Weldon mud,’ as described, is used over again, while the
calcium chloride liquor runs away.</p>

<p>The <i>Deacon process</i> depends mainly on leading the stream
of hydrochloric acid gas evolved from a saltcake pot mixed
with air and heated into a tower containing broken bricks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the size of a nut saturated with copper chloride. Chlorine is
evolved according to the equation:</p>

<ul>
<li>2HCl + O = 2Cl + H₂O.</li>

(<i>after Ost</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>electrolytic production</i> of chlorine with simultaneous
production of <i>caustic alkali</i> is increasing and depends on the
splitting up of alkaline chlorides by a current of electricity. The
chlorine evolved at the anode and the alkaline liquor formed at
the cathode must be kept apart to prevent secondary formation
of hypochlorite and chlorate (see below). This separation is
generally effected in one of three ways: (1) In the diaphragm
process (Griesheim-Elektron
chemical
works) the anode
and cathode are kept
separate by porous
earthenware diaphragms
arranged as
illustrated in <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>.
The anode consists
of gas carbon, or is
made by pressing
and firing a mixture
of charcoal and tar;
it lies inside the
diaphragm. The
chlorine developed
in the anodal cell is carried away by a pipe. The metal
vessel serves as the cathode. The alkali, which, since it contains
chloride, is recovered as caustic soda after evaporation
and crystallisation, collects in the cathodal space lying
outside the diaphragm. (2) By the Bell method (chemical
factory at Aussig) the anodal and cathodal fluids, which keep
apart by their different specific weights, are separated by a
stoneware bell; the poles consist of sheet iron and carbon.
The containing vessel is of stoneware. (3) In the mercury
process (England) sodium chloride is electrolysed without
a diaphragm, mercury serving as the cathode. This takes
up the sodium, which is afterwards recovered from the
amalgam formed by means of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>If <i>chlorate</i> or <i>hypochlorite</i> is to be obtained electrolytically,
electrodes of the very resistant but expensive platinum iridium
are used without a diaphragm. Chlorine is developed—not
free, but combined with the caustic potash. The bleaching
fluid obtained electrolytically in this way is a rival of bleaching
powder.</p>

<p><i>Bleaching powder</i> is made from chlorine obtained by the
Weldon or Deacon process. Its preparation depends on the
fact that calcium hydrate takes up chlorine in the cold with
formation of calcium hypochlorite after the equation:</p>

<ul>
<li>2Ca(OH)₂ + 4Cl = Ca(ClO)₂ + CaCl₂ + 2H₂O.</li>
</ul>

<p>The resulting product contains from 35 to 36 per cent.
chlorine, which is given off again when treated with acids.</p>

<p>The preparation of chloride of lime takes place in bleaching
powder chambers made of sheets of lead and Yorkshire flagstones.
The lime is spread out on the floors of these and
chlorine introduced. Before the process is complete the lime
must be turned occasionally.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of bleaching powder from Deacon
chlorine, Hasenclever has constructed a special cylindrical
apparatus (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>), consisting of several superimposed cast-iron
cylinders in which are worm arrangements carrying the lime
along, while chlorine gas passes over in an opposite direction.
This continuous process is, however, only possible for the
Deacon chlorine strongly diluted with nitrogen and oxygen
and not for undiluted Weldon gas.</p>

<p><i>Liquid chlorine</i> can be obtained by pressure and cooling
from concentrated almost pure Weldon chlorine gas.</p>

<p><i>Potassium chlorate</i>, which, as has been said, is now mostly
obtained electrolytically, was formerly obtained by passing
Deacon chlorine into milk of lime and decomposing the calcium
chlorate formed by potassium chloride.</p>

<p>Chlorine and chloride of lime are used for bleaching;
chlorine further is used in the manufacture of colours; chloride
of lime as a mordant in cloth printing and in the preparation of
chloroform; the chlorates are oxidising agents and used in
making safety matches. The manufacture of organic chlorine
products will be dealt with later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—In these industries the possibility
of injury to health and poisoning by inhalation of chlorine
gas is prominent. Leymann has shown that persons employed
in the manufacture of chlorine and bleaching powder suffer
from diseases of the respiratory organs 17·8 per cent., as contrasted
with 8·8 per cent. in other workers: and this is without
doubt attributable to the injurious effect of chlorine gas, which
it is hardly possible to avoid despite the fact that Leymann’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
figures refer to a model factory. But the figures show also
that as the industry became perfected the number of cases of
sickness steadily diminished.</p>

<p>Most cases occur from unsatisfactory conditions in the
production of chloride of lime, especially if the chloride of
lime chambers leak, if the lime is turned over while the
chlorine is being let in, by too early entrance into chambers
insufficiently ventilated, and by careless and unsuitable
methods of emptying the finished bleaching powder.</p>

<p>The possibility of injury is naturally greater from the
concentrated gas prepared by the Weldon process than from
the diluted gas of the Deacon process—the more so as in the
latter the bleaching powder is made in the Hasenclever closed-in
cylindrical apparatus in which the chlorine is completely
taken up by the lime. The safest process of all is the electrolytic,
as, if properly arranged, there should be no escape of
chlorine gas. The chlorine developed in the cells (when carried
out on the large scale) is drawn away by fans and conducted in
closed pipes to the place where it is used.</p>

<p>Many researches have been published as to the character
of the skin affection well known under the name of <i>chlorine
rash</i> (chlorakne). Some maintain that it is not due to chlorine
at all, but is an eczema set up by tar. Others maintain that
it is due to a combined action of chlorine and tar. Support to
this view is given by the observation that cases of chlorine rash,
formerly of constant occurrence in a factory for electrolytic
manufacture of chlorine, disappeared entirely on substitution
of magnetite at the anode for carbon.<a href="#endnote8" id="endnote-ref8"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> The conclusion
seems justified that the constituents of the carbon or of the
surrounding material set up the condition.</p>

<p>Chlorine rash has been observed in an alkali works where
chlorine was not produced electrolytically, and under conditions
which suggested that compounds of tar and chlorine were the
cause. In this factory for the production of salt cake by the
Hargreaves’ process cakes of rock salt were prepared and, for
the purpose of drying, conveyed on an endless metal band
through a stove. To prevent formation of crusts the band
was tarred. The salt blocks are decomposed in the usual
way by sulphur dioxide, steam, and oxygen of the air, and
the hydrochloric acid vapour led through Deacon towers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
which the decomposition of the hydrochloric acid into chlorine
and water is effected by metal salts in the manner characteristic
of the Deacon process. These salts are introduced in small
earthenware trays which periodically have to be removed and
renewed; the persons engaged in doing this were those affected.
The explanation was probably that the tar sticking to the salt
blocks distilled in the saltcake furnaces and formed a compound
with the chlorine which condensed on the earthenware
trays. When contact with these trays was recognised as the
cause, the danger was met by observance of the greatest cleanliness
in opening and emptying the Deacon towers.</p>

<p>Leymann<a href="#endnote9" id="endnote-ref9"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> is certain that the rash is due to chlorinated
products which emanate from the tar used in the construction
of the cells. And the affection has been found to be much
more prevalent when the contents of the cells are emptied
while the contents are still hot than when they are first
allowed to get cold.</p>

<p>Lehmann<a href="#endnote10" id="endnote-ref10"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> has approached the subject on the experimental
side, and is of opinion that probably chlorinated tar derivatives
(chlorinated phenols) are the cause of the trouble. Both he and
Roth think that the affection is due not to external irritation
of the skin, but to absorption of the poisonous substances into
the system and their elimination by way of the glands of the
skin.</p>

<p>In the section on manganese poisoning detailed reference
is made to the form of illness recently described in persons
employed in drying the regenerated Weldon mud.</p>

<p>Mercurial poisoning is possible when mercury is used in
the production of chlorine electrolytically.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of chlorates and hypochlorite, bleaching
fluids, &amp;c., injury to health from chlorine is possible in the
same way as has been described above.</p>

<h4>OTHER CHLORINE COMPOUNDS. BROMINE, IODINE, AND
FLUORINE</h4>

<p>Chlorine is used for the production of a number of organic
chlorine compounds, and in the manufacture of bromine and
iodine, processes which give rise to the possibility of injury
to health and poisoning by chlorine; further, several of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
substances so prepared are themselves corrosive or irritating
or otherwise poisonous. Nevertheless, severe poisoning and
injurious effects can be almost entirely avoided by adoption
of suitable precautions. In the factory to which Leymann’s
figures refer, where daily several thousand kilos of chlorine
and organic chlorine compounds are prepared, a relatively
very favourable state of health of the persons employed was
noted. At all events the preparation of chlorine by the electrolytic
process takes place in closed vessels admirably adapted
to avoid any escape of chlorine gas except as the result of
breakage of the apparatus or pipes. When this happens,
however, the pipes conducting the gas can be immediately
disconnected and the chlorine led into other apparatus or
into the bleaching powder factory.</p>

<p>As such complete precautionary arrangements are not
everywhere to be found, we describe briefly the most important
of the industries in question and the poisoning recognised in
them.</p>

<p><i>Chlorides of phosphorus.</i>—By the action of dry chlorine
on an excess of heated amorphous phosphorus, trichloride is
formed (PCl₃), a liquid having a sharp smell and causing lachrymation,
which fumes in the air, and in presence of water decomposes
into phosphorous acid and hydrochloric acid. On heating
with dry oxidising substances it forms phosphorus oxychloride
(see below), which is used for the production of acid chlorides.
By continuous treatment with chlorine it becomes converted
into phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅), which also is conveniently
prepared by passing chlorine through a solution of phosphorus
in carbon bisulphide, the solution being kept cold; it is crystalline,
smells strongly, and attacks the eyes and lungs. With
excess of water it decomposes into phosphoric acid and hydrochloric
acid: with slight addition of water it forms phosphorus
oxychloride (POCl₃). On the large scale this is prepared by
reduction of phosphate of lime in the presence of chlorine with
carbon or carbonic oxide. Phosphorus oxychloride, a colourless
liquid, fumes in the air and is decomposed by water into
phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>In the preparation of chlorides of phosphorus, apart
from the danger of chlorine gas and hydrochloric acid, the
poisonous effect of phosphorus and its compounds (see Phosphorus)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and even of carbon disulphide (as the solvent of
phosphorus) and of carbonic oxide (in the preparation of
phosphorus oxychloride) have to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Further, the halogen compounds of phosphorus exert
irritant action on the eyes and lungs similar to chloride of
sulphur as a result of their splitting up on the moist mucous
membranes into hydrochloric acid and an oxyacid of phosphorus.<a href="#endnote11" id="endnote-ref11"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> </p>

<p>Unless, therefore, special measures are taken, the persons
employed in the manufacture of phosphorus chlorides suffer
markedly from the injurious emanations given off.<a href="#endnote12" id="endnote-ref12"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> </p>

<p>Leymann<a href="#endnote13" id="endnote-ref13"><span class="endnote-marker">6</span></a> mentions one case of poisoning by phosphorus
chloride as having occurred in the factory described by him.
By a defect in the outlet arrangement phosphorus oxychloride
flowed into a workroom. Symptoms of poisoning
(sensation of suffocation, difficulty of breathing, lachrymation,
&amp;c.) at once attacked the occupants; before much gas had
escaped, the workers rushed out. Nevertheless, they suffered
from severe illness of the respiratory organs (bronchial catarrh
and inflammation of the lungs, with frothy, blood-stained
expectoration, &amp;c.).<a href="#endnote14" id="endnote-ref14"><span class="endnote-marker">7</span></a> </p>

<p><i>Chlorides of sulphur.</i>—Monochloride of sulphur (S₂Cl₂) is
made by passing dried, washed chlorine gas into molten
heated sulphur. The oily, brown, fuming liquid thus made
is distilled over into a cooled condenser and by redistillation
purified from the sulphur carried over with it. Sulphur monochloride
can take up much sulphur, and when saturated is
used in the vulcanisation of indiarubber, and, further, is used
to convert linseed and beetroot oil into a rubber substitute.
Monochloride of sulphur is decomposed by water into sulphur
dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and sulphur. By further action
of chlorine on the monochloride, sulphur dichloride (SCl₂) and
the tetrachloride (SCl₄) are formed.</p>

<p>In its preparation and use (see also Indiarubber Manufacture)
the injurious action of chlorine, of hydrochloric acid,
and of sulphur dioxide comes into play.</p>

<p>The monochloride has very irritating effects. Leymann cites
an industrial case of poisoning by it. In the German factory
inspectors’ reports for 1897 a fatal case is recorded. The
shirt of a worker became saturated with the material owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to the bursting of a bottle. First aid was rendered by pouring
water over him, thereby increasing the symptoms, which proved
fatal the next day. Thus the decomposition brought about by
water already referred to aggravated the symptoms.</p>

<p><i>Zinc chloride</i> (ZnCl₂) is formed by heating zinc in presence of
chlorine. It is obtained pure by dissolving pure zinc in hydrochloric
acid and treating this solution with chlorine. Zinc
chloride is obtained on the large scale by dissolving furnace
calamine (zinc oxide) in hydrochloric acid. Zinc chloride is
corrosive. It is used for impregnating wood and in weighting
goods. Besides possible injury to health from chlorine and
hydrogen chloride, risk of arseniuretted hydrogen poisoning
is present in the manufacture if the raw materials contain
arsenic. Eulenburg considers that in soldering oppressive
zinc chloride fumes may come off if the metal to be soldered is
first wiped with hydrochloric acid and then treated with the
soldering iron.</p>

<p><i>Rock salt.</i>—Mention may be made that even to salt in
combination with other chlorides (calcium chloride, magnesium
chloride, &amp;c.) injurious effects are ascribed. Ulcers
and perforation of the septum of the nose in salt-grinders
and packers who were working in a room charged with salt
dust are described.<a href="#endnote15" id="endnote-ref15"><span class="endnote-marker">8</span></a> These effects are similar to those produced
by the bichromates.</p>

<h4>Organic Chlorine Compounds</h4>

<p><i>Carbon oxychloride</i> (COCl₂, carbonyl dichloride, phosgene)
is produced by direct combination of chlorine and carbonic
oxide in presence of animal charcoal. Phosgene is itself a very
poisonous gas which, in addition to the poisonous qualities of
carbonic oxide (which have to be borne in mind in view of
the method of manufacture), acts as an irritant of the mucous
membranes. Commercially it is in solution in toluene and
xylene, from which the gas is readily driven off by heating.
It is used in the production of various colours, such as crystal
violet, Victoria blue, auramine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A fatal case of phosgene gas poisoning in the report
of the Union of Chemical Industry for 1905 deserves
mention. The phosgene was kept in a liquefied state in iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bottles provided with a valve under 2·3 atm. pressure. The
valve of one of these bottles leaked, allowing large escape into
the workroom. Two workers tried but failed to secure the
valve. The cylinder was therefore removed by a worker, by
order of the manager, and placed in a cooling mixture, as
phosgene boils at 8° C. The man in question wore a helmet
into which air was pumped from the compressed air supply in
the factory. As the helmet became obscured through moisture
after five minutes the worker took it off. A foreman next put
on the cleaned mask, and kept the cylinder surrounded with
ice and salt for three-quarters of an hour, thus stopping the
escape of gas. Meanwhile, the first worker had again entered
the room, wearing a cloth soaked in dilute alcohol before his
mouth, in order to take a sack of salt to the foreman. An
hour and a half later he complained of being very ill, became
worse during the night, and died the following morning.
Although the deceased may have been extremely susceptible,
the case affords sufficient proof of the dangerous nature of
the gas, which in presence of moisture had decomposed into
carbonic acid and hydrochloric acid; the latter had acutely
attacked the mucous membrane of the respiratory passages
and set up fatal bronchitis. Further, it was found that
the leaden plugs of the valves had been eroded by the
phosgene.</p>

<p>Three further cases of industrial phosgene poisoning have
been reported,<a href="#endnote16" id="endnote-ref16"><span class="endnote-marker">9</span></a> one a severe case in which there was bronchitis
with blood-stained expectoration, great dyspnœa, and weakness
of the heart’s action. The affected person was successfully
treated with ether and oxygen inhalations. Phosgene may
act either as the whole molecule, or is inhaled to such degree
that the carbonic oxide element plays a part.</p>

<p>In another case of industrial phosgene poisoning the
symptoms were those of severe irritation of the bronchial
mucous membrane and difficulty of breathing.<a href="#endnote17" id="endnote-ref17"><span class="endnote-marker">10</span></a> The case
recovered, although sensitiveness of the air passages lasted a
long time.</p>

<p><i>Carbon chlorine compounds</i> (<i>aliphatic series</i>).—<i>Methyl
chloride</i> (CH₃Cl) or chlormethane is prepared from methyl
alcohol and hydrochloric acid (with chloride of zinc) or methyl
alcohol, salt, and sulphuric acid. It is prepared in France on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
large scale from beetroot <i>vinasse</i> by dry distillation of the
evaporation residue. The distillate, which contains methyl
alcohol, trimethylamine, and other methylated amines, is
heated with hydrochloric acid; the methyl chloride so obtained
is purified, dried and compressed. It is used in the preparation
of pure chloroform, in the coal-tar dye industry, and in surgery
(as a local anæsthetic). In the preparation of methyl chloride
there is risk from methyl alcohol, trimethylamine, &amp;c. Methyl
chloride itself is injurious to health.</p>

<p><i>Methylene chloride</i> (CH₂Cl₂, dichlormethane) is prepared in
a similar way. It is very poisonous.</p>

<p><i>Carbon tetrachloride</i> (CCl₄, tetrachlormethane) is technically
important. It is prepared by passing chlorine gas into carbon
bisulphide with antimony or aluminium chloride. Carbon
tetrachloride is a liquid suitable for the extraction of fat or
grease (as in chemical cleaning), and has the advantage of being
non-inflammable. Carbon tetrachloride, so far as its poisonous
qualities are concerned, is to be preferred to other extractives
(see Carbon Bisulphide, Benzine, &amp;c.); for the rest it causes
unconsciousness similar to chloroform.</p>

<p>When manufactured industrially, in addition to the poisonous
effect of chlorine, the poisonous carbon bisulphide has also
to be borne in mind.</p>

<p><i>Ethyl chloride</i> (C₂H₅Cl) is made in a way analogous to
methyl chloride by the action of hydrochloric acid on ethyl
alcohol and chloride of zinc. It is used in medicine as a
narcotic.</p>

<p><i>Monochloracetic acid.</i>—In the preparation of monochloracetic
acid hydrochloric acid is developed in large quantity.
From it and anthranilic acid artificial indigo is prepared
(according to Heuman) by means of caustic potash.</p>

<p><i>Chloral</i> (CCl₃CHO, trichloracetaldehyde) is produced by
chlorinating alcohol. Chloral is used in the preparation of
pure chloroform and (by addition of water) of chloral hydrate
(trichloracetaldehyde hydrate), the well-known soporific.</p>

<p><i>Chloroform</i> (CHCl₃, trichlormethane).—Some methods for
the preparation of chloroform have been already mentioned
(Chloral, Methyl Chloride). Technically it is prepared by
distillation of alcohol or acetone with bleaching powder. The
workers employed are said to be affected by the stupefying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
vapours. Further, there is the risk of chlorine gas from use of
chloride of lime.</p>

<p><i>Chloride of nitrogen</i> (NCl₃) is an oily, volatile, very explosive,
strongly smelling substance, which irritates the eyes and nose
violently and is in every respect dangerous; it is obtained
from the action of chlorine or hypochlorous acid on sal-ammoniac.
The poisonous nature of these substances may
come into play. Risk of formation of chloride of nitrogen
can arise in the production of gunpowder from nitre containing
chlorine.</p>

<p><i>Cyanogen chloride</i> (CNCl).—Cyanogen chloride is made
from hydrocyanic acid or cyanide of mercury and chlorine.
Cyanogen chloride itself is an extremely poisonous and irritating
gas, and all the substances from which it is made are
also poisonous. According to Albrecht cyanogen chloride
can arise in the preparation of red prussiate of potash (by
passage of chlorine gas into a solution of the yellow prussiate)
if the solution is treated with chlorine in excess; the workers
may thus be exposed to great danger.</p>

<p><i>Chlorobenzene.</i>—In his paper referred to Leymann cites
three cases of poisoning by chlorobenzene, one by dinitrochlorobenzene,
and, further, three cases of burning by chlorobenzene
and one by benzoyl chloride (C₆H₅COCl). The last
named is made by treating benzaldehyde with chlorine, and
irritates severely the mucous membranes, while decomposing
into hydrochloric acid and benzoic acid.<a href="#endnote18" id="endnote-ref18"><span class="endnote-marker">11</span></a> Benzal chloride
(C₆H₅CHCl₂), benzo trichloride (C₆H₅CCl₃), and benzyl chloride
(C₆H₅CH₂Cl) are obtained by action of chlorine on boiling
toluene. The vapours of these volatile products irritate the
respiratory passages. In the manufacture there is risk from
the effect of chlorine gas and toluene vapour (see Benzene,
Toluene).</p>

<p>Leymann<a href="#endnote19" id="endnote-ref19"><span class="endnote-marker">12</span></a> describes in detail six cases of poisoning in
persons employed in a chlorobenzene industry, of which two
were due to nitrochlorobenzene. Symptoms of poisoning—headache,
cyanosis, fainting, &amp;c.—were noted in a person
working for three weeks with chlorobenzene.<a href="#endnote20" id="endnote-ref20"><span class="endnote-marker">13</span></a> </p>

<p>In Lehmann’s opinion chlorine rash, the well-recognised
skin affection of chlorine workers, may be due to contact with
substances of the chlorbenzol group.<a href="#endnote21" id="endnote-ref21"><span class="endnote-marker">14</span></a> </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Iodine and iodine compounds.</i>—Formerly iodine was obtained
almost exclusively from the liquor formed by lixiviation
of the ash of seaweed (kelp, &amp;c.); now the principal sources are
the mother liquors from Chili saltpetre and other salt industries.
From the concentrated liquor the iodine is set free by means
of chlorine or oxidising substances and purified by distillation
and sublimation. Iodine is used for the preparation of photographic
and pharmaceutical preparations, especially iodoform
(tri-iodomethane, CHI₃), which is made by acting with iodine
and caustic potash on alcohol, aldehyde, acetone, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Apart from possible injurious action of chlorine when used
in the preparation of iodine, workers are exposed to the possibility
of chronic iodine poisoning. According to Ascher<a href="#endnote22" id="endnote-ref22"><span class="endnote-marker">15</span></a>
irritation effects, nervous symptoms, and gastric ulceration
occur in iodine manufacture and use. He considers that
bromide of iodine used in photography produces these irritating
effects most markedly. Layet and also Chevallier in older
literature have made the same observations.</p>

<p>The Swiss Factory Inspectors’ Report for 1890-1 describes
two acute cases of iodine poisoning in a factory where organic
iodine compounds were made; one terminated fatally (severe
cerebral symptoms, giddiness, diplopia, and collapse).</p>

<p><i>Bromine and bromine compounds.</i>—Bromine is obtained
(as in the case of iodine) principally from the mother liquors of
salt works (especially Stassfurt saline deposits) by the action
of chlorine or nascent oxygen on the bromides of the alkalis
and alkaline earths in the liquors. They are chiefly used in
photography (silver bromide), in medicine (potassium bromide,
&amp;c.), and in the coal-tar dye industry.</p>

<p>The danger of bromine poisoning (especially of the chronic
form) is present in its manufacture and use, but there is no
positive evidence of the appearance of the bromine rash among
the workers. On the other hand, instances are recorded of
poisoning by methyl bromide, and the injurious effect of
bromide of iodine has been referred to.</p>

<p><i>Methyl iodide and methyl bromide.</i>—Methyl iodide (CH₃I),
a volatile fluid, is obtained by distillation of wood spirit with
amorphous phosphorus and iodine; it is used in the production
of methylated tar colours and for the production of various
methylene compounds. Grandhomme describes, in the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
already referred to, six cases, some very severe, of poisoning
by the vapour of methyl iodide among workers engaged in the
preparation of antipyrin, which is obtained by the action of
aceto-acetic ether on phenyl hydrazine, treatment of the pyrazolone
so obtained with methyl iodide, and decomposition of the
product with caustic soda. A case of methyl iodide poisoning
is described in a factory operative, who showed symptoms
similar to those described for methyl bromide except that the
psychical disturbance was more marked.<a href="#endnote23" id="endnote-ref23"><span class="endnote-marker">16</span></a> </p>

<p>Three cases of methyl bromide (CH₃Br) poisoning are
described in persons preparing the compound.<a href="#endnote24" id="endnote-ref24"><span class="endnote-marker">17</span></a> One of these
terminated fatally. There is some doubt as to whether
these cases were really methyl bromide poisoning. But later
cases of methyl bromide poisoning are known, and hence the
dangerous nature of this chemical compound is undoubted.
Thus the Report of the Union of Chemical Industry for
1904 gives the following instance: Two workers who had to
deal with an ethereal solution of methyl bromide became ill
with symptoms of alcoholic intoxication. One suffered for a
long time from nervous excitability, attacks of giddiness, and
drowsiness. Other cases of poisoning from methyl bromide
vapour are recorded with severe nervous symptoms and even
collapse.</p>

<p><i>Fluorine compounds.</i>—<i>Hydrogen fluoride</i> (HFl) commercially
is a watery solution, which is prepared by decomposition
of powdered fluorspar by sulphuric acid in cast-iron
vessels with lead hoods. The escaping fumes are collected in
leaden condensers surrounded with water; sometimes to get
a very pure product it is redistilled in platinum vessels.</p>

<p>Hydrogen fluoride is used in the preparation of the fluorides
of antimony, of which antimony fluoride ammonium sulphate
(SbFl₃(NH₄)₂SO₄) has wide use in dyeing as a substitute for
tartar emetic. It is produced by dissolving oxide of antimony
in hydrofluoric acid with addition of ammonium sulphate and
subsequent concentration and crystallisation. Hydrofluoric
acid is used for etching glass (see also Glass Industry).</p>

<p>In brewing, an unpurified silico-fluoric acid mixed with
silicic acid, clay, oxide of iron, and oxide of zinc called Salufer
is used as a disinfectant and preservative.</p>

<p><i>Hydrofluoric acid and silicofluoric acid</i> (H₂SiFl₆) arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
further in the superphosphate industry by the action of
sulphuric acid on the phosphorites whereby silicofluoric acid
is obtained as a bye-product (see also Manufacture of Artificial
Manure). Hydrofluoric acid and its derivatives both in their
manufacture and use and in the superphosphate industry
affect the health of the workers.</p>

<p>If hydrogen fluoride or its compounds escape into the
atmosphere they attack the respiratory passages and set up
inflammation of the eyes; further, workers handling the
watery solutions are prone to skin affections (ulceration).</p>

<p>The following are examples of the effects produced.<a href="#endnote25" id="endnote-ref25"><span class="endnote-marker">18</span></a> A
worker in an art establishment upset a bottle of hydrofluoric
acid and wetted the inner side of a finger of the right hand.
Although he immediately washed his hands, a painful inflammation
with formation of blisters similar to a burn of the second
degree came on within a few hours. The blister became
infected and suppurated.</p>

<p>A man and his wife wished to obliterate the printing on the
top of porcelain beer bottle stoppers with hydrofluoric acid.
The man took a cloth, moistened a corner of it, and then rubbed
the writing off. After a short time he noticed a slight burning
sensation and stopped. His wife, who wore an old kid glove
in doing the work, suffered from the same symptoms, the pain
from which in the night became unbearable, and in spite of
medical treatment gangrene of the finger-tips ensued. Healing
took place with suppuration and loss of the finger-nails.</p>

<p>Injury of the respiratory passages by hydrofluoric acid has
often been reported. In one factory for its manufacture the
hydrofluoric acid vapour was so great that all the windows to a
height of 8 metres were etched dull.</p>

<p>Several cases of poisoning by hydrofluoric acid were noted
by me when examining the certificates of the Sick Insurance
Society of Bohemia. In 1906 there were four due to inhalation
of vapour of hydrofluoric acid in a hydrofluoric acid factory,
with symptoms of corrosive action on the mucous membrane of
the respiratory tract. In 1907 there was a severe case in the
etching of glass.<a href="#endnote26" id="endnote-ref26"><span class="endnote-marker">19</span></a> </p>

<h4>NITRIC ACID.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Manufacture and Uses.</span>—<i>Nitric acid</i> (HNO₃) is obtained
by distillation when Chili saltpetre (sodium nitrate) is decomposed
by sulphuric acid in cast-iron retorts according to the
equation:</p>

<ul>
<li>NaNO₃ + H₂SO₄ = NaHSO₄ + HNO₃.</li>
</ul>

<p>Condensation takes place in fireclay Woulff bottles connected
to a coke tower in the same way as has been described in
the manufacture of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="fig9">

<img src="images/fig9.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>—Preparation of Nitric Acid (<i>after Ost</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>Lunge-Rohrmann plate towers are also used instead of the
coke tower. Earthenware fans—as is the case with acid gases
generally—serve to aspirate the nitrous fumes.</p>

<p>To free the nitric acid of the accompanying lower oxides of
nitrogen (as well as chlorine, compounds of chlorine and other
impurities) air is blown into the hot acid. The mixture of
sodium sulphate and sodium bisulphate remaining in the
retorts is either converted into sulphate by addition of salt or
used in the manufacture of glass.</p>

<p>The nitric acid obtained is used either as such or mixed with
sulphuric acid or with hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>Pure nitric acid cannot at ordinary atmospheric pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
be distilled unaltered, becomes coloured on distillation, and
turns red when exposed to light. It is extremely dangerous to
handle, as it sets light to straw, for example, if long in contact
with it. It must be packed, therefore, in kieselguhr earth,
and when in glass carboys forwarded only in trains for transport
of inflammable material.</p>

<p>Red, <i>fuming nitric acid</i>, a crude nitric acid, contains much
nitrous and nitric oxides. It is produced if in the distillation
process less sulphuric acid and a higher temperature are
employed or (by reduction) if starch meal is added.</p>

<p>The successful production of nitric acid from the air must be
referred to. It is effected by electric discharges in special
furnaces from which the air charged with nitrous gas is led into
towers where the nitric oxide is further oxidised (to tetroxide),
and finally, by contact with water, converted into nitric acid.</p>

<p>Nitric acid is used in the manufacture of phosphoric acid,
arsenious acid, and sulphuric acid, nitro-glycerin and nitrocellulose,
smokeless powder, &amp;c. (see the section on Explosives),
in the preparation of nitrobenzenes, picric acid, and other
nitro-compounds (see Tar Products, &amp;c.). The diluted acid
serves for the solution and etching of metals, also for the preparation
of nitrates, such as the nitrates of mercury, silver, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Leymann considers that the average
number of cases and duration of sickness among persons employed
in the nitric acid industry are generally on the increase;
the increase relates almost entirely to burns which can hardly
be avoided with so strongly corrosive an acid. The number of
burns amounts almost to 12 per cent. according to Leymann’s
figures (i.e. on an average 12 burns per 100 workers), while
among the packers, day labourers, &amp;c., in the same
industry the proportion is only 1 per cent. Affections
of the respiratory tract are fairly frequent (11·8 per cent.
as compared with 8·8 per cent. of other workers), which is no
doubt to be ascribed to the corrosive action of nitrous fumes
on the mucous membranes. Escape of acid fumes can occur
in the manufacture of nitric acid though leaky retorts, pipes,
&amp;c., and injurious acid fumes may be developed in the workrooms
from the bisulphate when withdrawn from the retorts,
which is especially the case when excess of sulphuric acid
is used. The poisonous nature of these fumes is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
great, as is shown by cases in which severe poisoning has
been reported from merely carrying a vessel containing fuming
nitric acid.<a href="#endnote27" id="endnote-ref27"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> </p>

<p>Frequent accidents occur through the corrosive action of
the acid or from breathing the acid fumes—apart from the
dangers mentioned in the manufacture—in filling, packing,
and despatching the acid—especially if appropriate vessels
are not used and they break. Of such accidents several are
reported.</p>

<p>Further, reports of severe poisoning from the use of nitric
acid are numerous. Inhalation of nitrous fumes (nitrous
and nitric oxides, &amp;c.) does not immediately cause severe
symptoms or death; severe symptoms tend to come on some
hours later, as the examples cited below show.</p>

<p>Occurrence of such poisoning has already been referred to
when describing the sulphuric acid industry. In the superphosphate
industry also poisoning has occurred by accidental
development of nitric oxide fumes on sodium nitrate mixing
with very acid superphosphate.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently poisoning arises in pickling metals
(belt making, pickling brass; cf. the chapter on Treatment
of Metals). Poisoning by nitrous fumes has frequently
been reported from the action of nitric acid on organic substances
whereby the lower oxides of nitrogen—nitrous
and nitric oxides—are given off. Such action of nitric
acid or of a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid on organic
substances is used for nitrating purposes (see Nitroglycerin;
Explosives; Nitrobenzol).</p>

<p>Through want of care, therefore, poisoning can arise in these
industries. Again, this danger is present on accidental contact
of escaping acid with organic substances (wood, paper, leather,
&amp;c.), as shown especially by fires thus created.<a href="#endnote28" id="endnote-ref28"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> </p>

<p>Thus, in a cellar were five large iron vessels containing a
mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids. One of the vessels was
found one morning to be leaking. The manager directed that
smoke helmets should be fetched, intending to pump out
the acid, and two plumbers went into the cellar to fix
the pump, staying there about twenty-five minutes. They
used cotton waste and handkerchiefs as respirators, but
did not put on the smoke helmets. One plumber suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
only from cough, but the other died the same evening with
symptoms of great dyspnœa. At the autopsy severe inflammation
and swelling of the mucous membrane of the palate,
pharynx and air passages, and congestion of the lungs were
found.</p>

<p>Two further fatal cases in the nitrating room are described
by Holtzmann. One of the two complained only a few hours
after entering the room of pains in the chest and giddiness.
He died two days later. The other died the day after entering
the factory, where he had only worked for three hours. In
both cases intense swelling and inflammation of the mucous
membrane was found.</p>

<p>Holtzmann mentions cases of poisoning by nitrous fumes in
the heating of an artificial manure consisting of a mixture of
saltpetre, brown coal containing sulphur, and wool waste.
Fatalities have been reported in workers who had tried to
mop up the spilt nitric acid with shavings.<a href="#endnote29" id="endnote-ref29"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> We quote the
following other instances<a href="#endnote30" id="endnote-ref30"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> :</p>

<p>(1) Fatal poisoning of a fireman who had rescued several
persons from a room filled with nitrous fumes the result of a
fire occasioned by the upsetting of a carboy. The rescued
suffered from bronchial catarrh, the rescuer dying from inflammation
and congestion of the lungs twenty-nine hours after the
inhalation of the gas.</p>

<p>(2) At a fire in a chemical factory three officers and fifty-seven
firemen became affected from inhalation of nitrous
fumes, of whom one died.</p>

<p>(3) In Elberfeld on an open piece of ground fifty carboys
were stored. One burst and started a fire. As a strong wind
was blowing the firemen were little affected by the volumes
of reddish fumes. Soon afterwards at the same spot some
fifty to sixty carboys were destroyed. Fifteen men successfully
extinguished the fire in a relatively still atmosphere in less
than half an hour. At first hardly any symptoms of discomfort
were felt. Three hours later all were seized with violent
suffocative attacks, which in one case proved fatal and in the
rest entailed nine to ten days’ illness from affection of the
respiratory organs.</p>

<p>The Report of the Union for Chemical Industry for 1908
describes a similar accident in a nitro-cellulose factory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Of those engaged in extinguishing the fire twenty-two were
affected, and in spite of medical treatment and use of the
oxygen apparatus three died.</p>

<p>From the same source we quote the following examples:</p>

<p>In a denitrating installation (see Nitro-glycerin; Explosives)
a man was engaged in blowing, by means of compressed air,
weak nitric acid from a stoneware vessel sunk in the ground
into a washing tower. As the whole system was already under
high pressure the vessel suddenly exploded, and in doing so
smashed a wooden vat containing similar acid, which spilt on
the ground with sudden development of tetroxide vapours.
The man inhaled much gas, but except for pains in the chest
felt no serious symptoms at the time and continued to work
the following day. Death occurred the next evening from
severe dyspnœa.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar case occurred in the nitrating room of
a dynamite factory in connection with the cleaning of a waste
acid egg; the vessel had for several days been repeatedly
washed out with water made alkaline with unslaked lime.
Two men then in turn got into the egg in order to remove
the lime and lead deposit, compressed air being continuously
blown in through the manhole. The foreman remained
about a quarter of an hour and finished the cleaning
without feeling unwell. Difficulty of breathing came on
in the evening, and death ensued on the following day.</p>

<p>In another case a worker was engaged in washing nitroxylene
when, through a leak, a portion of the contents collected in
a pit below. He then climbed into the pit and scooped the
nitroxylene which had escaped into jars. This work took
about three-quarters of an hour, and afterwards he complained
of difficulty of breathing and died thirty-six hours later.<a href="#endnote31" id="endnote-ref31"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> </p>

<p>A worker again had to control a valve regulating the
flow to two large vessels serving to heat or cool the nitrated
liquid. Both vessels were provided with pressure gauges and
open at the top. Through carelessness one of the vessels ran over,
and instead of leaving the room after closing the valve, the
man tried to get rid of the traces of his error, remaining in the
atmosphere charged with the fumes,<a href="#endnote32" id="endnote-ref32"><span class="endnote-marker">6</span></a> and was poisoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h4>Nitric and Nitrous Salts and Compounds</h4>

<p>When dissolving in nitric acid the substances necessary for
making the various nitrates, nitric and nitrous oxides escape.
In certain cases nitric and hydrochloric acids are used together
to dissolve metals such as platinum and gold and ferric oxides,
when chlorine as well as nitrous oxide escapes. Mention is
necessary of the following:</p>

<p><i>Barium nitrate</i> (Ba(NO₃)₂) is prepared as a colourless
crystalline substance by acting on barium carbonate or barium
sulphide with nitric acid. Use is made of it in fireworks
(green fire) and explosives. In analogous way strontium
nitrate (Sr(NO₃)₂) is made and used for red fire.</p>

<p><i>Ammonium nitrate</i> (NH₄NO₃), a colourless crystalline substance,
is obtained by neutralising nitric acid with ammonia
or ammonium carbonate, and is also made by dissolving
iron or tin in nitric acid. It is used in the manufacture of
explosives.</p>

<p><i>Lead nitrate</i> (Pb(NO₃)₂), a colourless crystalline substance,
is made by dissolving lead oxide or carbonate in nitric acid.
It is used in dyeing and calico printing, in the preparation
of chrome yellow and other lead compounds, and mixed with
lead peroxide (obtained by treatment of red lead with nitric
acid) in the manufacture of lucifer matches. Apart from risk
from nitrous fumes (common to all these salts) there is risk
also of chronic lead poisoning.</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of iron</i> (Fe(NO₃)₂), forming green crystals, is made
by dissolving sulphide of iron or iron in cold dilute nitric acid.
The so-called nitrate of iron commonly used in dyeing consists
of basic sulphate of iron (used largely in the black dyeing of
silk).</p>

<p><i>Copper nitrate</i> (Cu(NO₃)₂), prepared in a similar way, is
also used in dyeing.</p>

<p><i>Mercurous nitrate</i> (Hg₂(NO₃)₂) is of great importance
industrially, and is produced by the action of cold dilute
nitric acid on an excess of mercury. It is used for ‘carotting’
rabbit skins in felt hat making, for colouring horn, for
etching, and for forming an amalgam with metals, in making
a black bronze on brass (art metal), in painting on porcelain, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Mercuric nitrate</i> (Hg(NO₃)₂) is made by dissolving mercury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in nitric acid or by treating mercury with excess of warm
nitric acid. Both the mercurous and mercuric salts act as
corrosives and are strongly poisonous (see also Mercury and
Hat Manufacture).</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of silver</i> (AgNO₃) is obtained by dissolving silver
in nitric acid and is used commercially as a caustic in the well-known
crystalline pencils (lunar caustic). Its absorption into
the system leads to accumulation of silver in the skin—the
so-called argyria (see Silver). Such cases of chronic poisoning
are recorded by Lewin.<a href="#endnote33" id="endnote-ref33"><span class="endnote-marker">7</span></a> Argyria occurs among photographers
and especially in the silvering of glass pearls owing to introduction
of a silver nitrate solution into the string of pearls by
suction. In northern Bohemia, where the glass pearl industry
is carried on in the homes of the workers, I saw a typical case.
The cases are now rare, as air pumps are used instead of the
mouth.</p>

<p><i>Sodium nitrite</i> (NaNO₂) is obtained by melting Chili saltpetre
with metallic lead in cast-iron vessels. The mass is
lixiviated and the crystals obtained on evaporation. The
lead oxide produced is specially suitable for making red
lead. Cases of lead poisoning are frequent and sometimes
severe. Roth<a href="#endnote34" id="endnote-ref34"><span class="endnote-marker">8</span></a> mentions a factory where among 100 employed
there were 211 attacks in a year.</p>

<p><i>Amyl nitrite</i> (C₅H₁₁NO₂) is made by leading nitrous fumes
into iso-amyl alcohol and distilling amyl alcohol with potassium
nitrite and sulphuric acid. It is a yellowish fluid, the fumes
of which when inhaled produce throbbing of the bloodvessels
in the head and rapid pulse.</p>

<p>For other nitric acid compounds see the following
section on Explosives and the section on Manufacture of Tar
Products (Nitro-benzene, &amp;c.).</p>

<h4>Explosives</h4>

<p>Numerous explosives are made with aid of nitric acid or a
mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids. Injury to health and
poisoning—especially through development of nitrous fumes—can
be caused. Further, some explosives are themselves
industrial poisons, especially those giving off volatile fumes
or dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The most important are:</p>

<p><i>Fulminate of mercury</i> (HgC₂N₂O₂) is probably to be
regarded as the mercury salt of fulminic acid, an isomer
of cyanic acid. It is used to make caps for detonating
gunpowder and explosives, and is made by dissolving
mercury in nitric acid and adding alcohol. The heavy white
crystals of mercury fulminate are filtered off and dried.
Very injurious fumes are produced in the reaction, containing
ethyl acetate, acetic acid, ethyl nitrate, nitrous acid, volatile
hydrocyanic acid compounds, hydrocyanic acid, ethyl cyanide,
cyanic acid; death consequently can immediately ensue on
inhalation of large quantities. The fulminate is itself poisonous,
and risk is present in filtering, pressing, drying, and granulating
it. Further, in filling the caps in the huts numerous cases of
poisoning occur. Heinzerling thinks here that mercury fumes
are developed by tiny explosions in the pressing and filling.
In a factory in Nuremburg 40 per cent. of the women employed
are said to have suffered from mercurial poisoning. Several
cases in a factory at Marseilles are recorded by Neisser.<a href="#endnote35" id="endnote-ref35"><span class="endnote-marker">9</span></a>
In addition to the risk from the salt there is even more
from nitrous fumes, which are produced in large quantity in the
fulminate department.</p>

<p><i>Nitro-glycerin</i> (C₃H₅(O—NO₂)₃, dynamite, explosive gelatine).—Nitro-glycerin
is made by action of a mixture of nitric
and sulphuric acids on anhydrous glycerin. The method of
manufacture is as follows (<a href="#fig10">see fig. 10</a>): glycerin is allowed
to flow into the acid mixture in leaden vessels; it is agitated
by compressed air and care taken that the temperature remains
at about 22° C., as above 25° there may be risk. The liquid is
then run off and separates into two layers, the lighter nitro-glycerin
floating on the top of the acid. The process is watched
through glass windows. The nitro-glycerin thus separated is run
off, washed by agitation with compressed air, then neutralised
(with soda solution) and again washed and lastly filtered. The
acid mixture which was run off is carefully separated by standing,
as any explosive oil contained in it will rise up. The waste
acid freed from nitro-glycerin is recovered in special apparatus,
being denitrified by hot air and steam blown through it.
The nitrous fumes are condensed to nitric acid. The sulphuric
acid is evaporated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dynamite</i> is made by mixing nitro-glycerin with infusorial
earth previously heated to redness and purified.</p>

<p><i>Blasting gelatine</i> is made by dissolving gun cotton (collodion
wool, nitro-cellulose) in nitro-glycerin. Both are pressed into
cartridge shape.</p>

<p>Nitro-glycerin itself is a strong poison which can be
absorbed both through the skin
and from the alimentary canal.
Kobert describes a case where
the rubbing of a single drop
into the skin caused symptoms
lasting for ten hours. Workmen
engaged in washing out
nitro-glycerin from the kieselguhr
earth, having in doing so
their bare arms immersed in
the liquid, suffered. Although
it be granted that nitro-glycerin
workers become to a large
extent acclimatised, cases of
poisoning constantly occur in
explosives factories referable to
the effect of nitro-glycerin.</p>

<p>Persons mixing and sieving
dynamite suffer from ulcers
under the nails and at the
finger-tips which are difficult to
heal. Further, where the apparatus
employed is not completely
enclosed nitrous fumes
escape and become a source of
danger. Formerly this danger
was constantly present in the
nitrating house where nitration
was effected in open vessels. Now that this is usually done
in closed nitrating apparatus with glass covers the danger
is mainly limited to the acid separating house, wash house,
and especially the room in which denitration of the waste
acids is effected.</p>

</div>

<p>A fatal case in a nitro-glycerin factory was reported in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
1902 where, through carelessness, a separator had overflowed.
The workman who tried to wash away the acid with water
inhaled so much of the nitrous fumes that he succumbed
sixteen hours later.</p>

<p>Other cases of poisoning by nitrous fumes occurring in the
denitrating department are described in detail in the section
on the use of nitric acid.</p>

<p>One of these occurred to a man forcing dilute nitric acid
from an earthenware egg by means of compressed air into a
washing tower. The egg burst and broke an acid tank. The
workman died on the following day.</p>

<p>A fatal case occurred in a dynamite factory in cleaning out a
storage tank for waste acid in spite of previous swilling and
ventilation.</p>

<p><i>Gun cotton</i> (<i>pyroxyline</i>) and its use.—Pyroxyline is the
collective name for all products of the action of nitric acid on
cellulose (cotton wool and similar material); these products
form nitric acid ester of cellulose (nitro-cellulose).</p>

<p>Gun cotton is formed by the action of strong nitric acid on
cellulose (cotton wool). A mixture of sulphuric and nitric
acids is allowed to act on cotton wool (previously freed from
grease, purified, and dried), with subsequent pressing and
centrifugalising. In the nitrating centrifugal machine (in the
Selvig-Lange method) both processes are effected at the same
time.</p>

<p>The interior of this apparatus is filled with nitric
acid, cotton wool is introduced, the acid fumes exhausted
through earthenware pipes, and the remainder of the acid
removed by the centrifugal machine; the nitrated material is
then washed, teazed in teazing machines, again washed,
neutralised with calcium carbonate, again centrifugalised, and
dried. Since drying in drying stoves is a great source of danger
of explosion, dehydration is effected with alcohol, and the gun
cotton intended for the production of smokeless powder carried
directly to the gelatinising vessels (see Smokeless Powder).</p>

<p>Gun cotton, apart from its use for smokeless powder, is
pressed in prisms and used for charging torpedoes and sea
mines.</p>

<p><i>Collodion cotton</i> is a partially nitrated cellulose. It is
prepared generally in the same way as gun cotton, except that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
it is treated with a more dilute acid. It is soluble (in contradistinction
to gun cotton) in alcohol-ether, and the solution
is known as collodion (as used in surgery, photography, and to
impregnate incandescent gas mantles). Mixed with camphor
and heated collodion forms celluloid.</p>

<p>In Chardonnet’s method for making artificial silk collodion
is used by forcing it through fine glass tubes and drawing
and spinning it. The alcohol-ether vapours are carried away
by fans and the spun material is de-nitrated by ammonium
sulphide.</p>

<p><i>Smokeless powder</i> is a gun cotton powder—that is gun
cotton the explosive power of which is utilised by bringing it
into a gelatinous condition. This is effected by gelatinising
the gun cotton with alcohol-ether or acetone (sometimes with
addition of camphor, resin, &amp;c.). A doughy, pasty mass results,
which is then rolled, washed, dried, and pressed into rods.
Nobel’s nitroleum (artillery powder) consists half of nitro-glycerin
and half of collodion cotton. In the production of
gun cotton and collodion cotton the workers are affected and
endangered by nitric and nitrous fumes unless the nitrating
apparatus is completely airtight.</p>

<p>Erosion of the incisor teeth is general, but use of the new
nitrating apparatus, especially of the nitrating centrifugal
machines already described, has greatly diminished the
evil. In making collodion, celluloid and artificial silk, in addition
to the risks referred to in the production of gun cotton,
the vapour from the solvents, ether, alcohol, acetone, acetic-ether,
and camphor, comes into consideration, but there is no
account of such poisoning in the literature of the subject.</p>

<p>Other explosives which belong to the aromatic series are
described in the chapter on Tar Derivatives, especially picric
acid.</p>

<h4>PHOSPHORUS AND PHOSPHORUS MATCHES</h4>

<p>The total production of <i>phosphorus</i> is not large. Formerly it
was prepared from bone ash. Now it is made from phosphorite,
which, as in the super-phosphate industry, is decomposed
by means of sulphuric acid, soluble phosphate and calcium
sulphate being formed; the latter is removed, the solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
evaporated, mixed with coal or coke powder, distilled in clay
retorts, and received in water.</p>

<p>Phosphorus is also obtained electro-chemically from a
mixture of tricalcium phosphate, carbon, and silicic acid,
re-distilled for further purification, and finally poured under
water into stick form.</p>

<p><i>Red phosphorus</i> (amorphous phosphorus) is obtained by
heating yellow phosphorus in the absence of air and subsequently
extracting with carbon bisulphide.</p>

<p><i>Phosphorus matches</i> are made by first fixing the wooden
splints in frames and then dipping the ends either into paraffin
or sulphur which serve to carry the flame to the wood. Then
follows dipping in the phosphorus paste proper, for which
suitable dipping machines are now used. The phosphorus
paste consists of yellow phosphorus, an oxidising agent (red
lead, lead nitrate, nitre, or manganese dioxide) and a binding
substance (dextrine, gum); finally the matches are dried and
packed.</p>

<p><i>Safety matches</i> are made in the same way, except that
there is no phosphorus. The paste consists of potassium
chlorate, sulphur, or antimony sulphide, potassium bichromate,
solution of gum or dextrine, and different admixtures such as
glass powder, &amp;c. These matches are saturated with paraffin
or ammonium phosphate. To strike them a special friction
surface is required containing red phosphorus, antimony
sulphide, and dextrine. In the act of striking the heat
generated converts a trace of the red phosphorus into the
yellow variety which takes fire.</p>

<p>Danger to health arises from the poisonous gases evolved
in the decomposition of the calcined bones by sulphuric
acid. When phosphorus is made from phosphorite the same
dangers to health are present as in the production of super-phosphate
artificial manure, which is characterised by the
generation of hydrofluoric and fluosilicic acids. In the
distillation of phosphorus phosphoretted hydrogen and phosphorus
fumes may escape and prove dangerous.</p>

<p>Industrial poisoning from the use of white phosphorus in
the manufacture of matches has greater interest than its
occurrence in the production of phosphorus itself. Already
in 1845 chronic phosphorus poisoning (phosphorus necrosis)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
had been observed by Lorinser, and carefully described by Bibra
and Geist in 1847. In the early years of its use phosphorus
necrosis must have been fairly frequent in lucifer match
factories, and not infrequently have led to death. This
necessitated preventive measures in various States (see Part III);
cases became fewer, but did not disappear altogether.</p>

<p>Especially dangerous is the preparation of the paste,
dipping, and manipulations connected with drying and filling
the matches into boxes. According to the reports of the
Austrian factory inspectors there are about 4500 lucifer match
workers in that country, among whom seventy-four cases of
necrosis are known to have occurred between the years 1900
and 1908 inclusive.</p>

<p>Teleky<a href="#endnote36" id="endnote-ref36"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> considers these figures much too small, and from
inquiries undertaken himself ascertained that 156 cases
occurred in Austria between 1896 and 1906, while factory
inspectors’ reports dealt with only seventy-five. He was of
opinion that his own figures were not complete, and thinks
that in the ten years 1896 to 1905 there must have been from
350 to 400 cases of phosphorus necrosis in the whole of Austria.
Despite strict regulations, modern equipment of the factories,
introduction of improved machinery, and limitation of the white
phosphorus match industry to large factories, it has not been
possible to banish the risk, and the same is true of Bohemia,
where there is always a succession of cases. Valuable statistics
of phosphorus necrosis in Hungary are available.<a href="#endnote37" id="endnote-ref37"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> In 1908
there were sixteen factories employing 1882 workers of whom
30 per cent. were young—children even were employed. The
industry is carried on in primitive fashion without hygienic
arrangements anywhere. It is strange that, notwithstanding
these bad conditions, among a large number of the workers
examined only fourteen active cases were found, in addition
to two commencing, and fifteen cured—altogether thirty-one
cases (excluding fifty-five cases in which there was some
other pathological change in the mouth). Altogether ninety-three
cases since 1900 were traced in Hungary, and in view
of the unsatisfactory situation preventive measures, short
of prohibition of the use of white phosphorus, would be
useless.</p>

<p>In England among 4000 lucifer match workers there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
thirteen cases in the years 1900 to 1907 inclusive. Diminution
in the number was due to improved methods of manufacture
and periodical dental examination prescribed under Special
Rules.</p>

<p>Phosphorus necrosis is not the only sign of industrial
phosphorus poisoning, as the condition of fragilitas ossium is
recognised.<a href="#endnote38" id="endnote-ref38"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> From what has been said it is evident that
preventive measures against phosphorus poisoning, although
they diminish the number, are not able to get rid of phosphorus
necrosis, and so civilised States have gradually been driven to
prohibit the use of white phosphorus (for the history of this
see Part III).</p>

<p>Use of chrome salts (especially potassium bichromate) in
the preparation of the paste causes risk of poisoning in premises
where ‘Swedish’ matches are made. Attention has been called
to the frequency of chrome ulceration.<a href="#endnote39" id="endnote-ref39"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> The paste used consists
of 3-6 per cent. chrome salt, so that each match head contains
about ½ mg. Wodtke found among eighty-four workers early
perforation of the septum in thirteen. Severe eczema also
has been noted.</p>

<p>It is even alleged that red phosphorus is not entirely free
from danger. Such cachexia as has been noted may be
referable to the absorption of potassium chlorate.</p>

<h5>Other Uses of Phosphorus and Compounds of Phosphorus</h5>

<p>Isolated cases of phosphorus poisoning have been observed
in the manufacture of phosphor-bronze. This consists of
90 parts copper, 9 parts tin, and 0·5 to 0·75 phosphorus.</p>

<p><i>Sulphides of phosphorus</i> (P₂S₅, P₄S₃, P₂S₃) are made by
melting together red phosphorus and sulphur. They make a
satisfactory substitute for the poisonous yellow phosphorus
and are considered non-poisonous, but the fact remains that
they give off annoying sulphuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p><i>Phosphoretted hydrogen gas</i> (PH₃) rarely gives rise to
industrial poisoning. It may come off in small amounts in
the preparation of acetylene and in the preparation of, and
manipulations with, white phosphorus. It is stated that in
acetylene made of American calcium carbide 0·04 per cent. of
phosphoretted hydrogen is present, and in acetylene from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Swedish calcium carbide 0·02 per cent.; Lunge and Cederkreutz
found an acetylene containing 0·06 per cent. These
amounts might cause poisoning if the gas were diffused in
confined spaces. Poisoning, in part attributable to phosphoretted
hydrogen gas, is brought about through ferro-silicon
(see under Ferro-silicon).</p>

<h5>Superphosphate and Artificial Manure</h5>

<p><i>Superphosphate</i>, an artificial manure, is prepared from
various raw materials having a high proportion of insoluble
basic calcium phosphate (tricalcium phosphate), which by
treatment with sulphuric acid are converted into the soluble
acid calcium phosphate (monocalcium phosphate) and calcium
sulphate. Mineral substances such as phosphorites, coprolites,
guano, bone ash, &amp;c., serve as the starting-point. Chamber
acid, or sometimes the waste acid from the preparation of
nitro-benzene or purification of petroleum, are used in the
conversion. The raw materials are ground in closed-in apparatus,
under negative pressure, and mixed with the sulphuric
acid in wooden lead-lined boxes or walled receptacles. The
product is then stored until the completion of the reaction
in ‘dens,’ dried, and pulverised in disintegrators.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of bone meal extraction of the
fat from the bones with benzine precedes treatment with
acid.</p>

<p>A further source of artificial manure is <i>basic slag</i>—the slag
left in the manufacture of steel by the Gilchrist-Thomas
method—which contains 10-25 per cent. of readily soluble
phosphoric acid. It requires, therefore, only to be ground into
a very fine powder to serve as a suitable manure.</p>

<p>Owing to the considerable heat generated by the action
of the sulphuric acid when mixed with the pulverised raw
materials (especially in the conversion of the phosphorites)
hydrofluoric and silicofluoric acid vapours are evolved in
appreciable amount, and also carbonic and hydrochloric
acid vapours, sulphur dioxide, and sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
These gases—notably such as contain fluorine—if not effectually
dealt with by air-tight apparatus and exhaust ventilation—may
lead to serious annoyance and injury to the persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
employed. Further, there is risk of erosion of the skin from
contact with the acid, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A case is described of pustular eczema on the scrotum
of a worker engaged in drying sodium silicofluoride, due
probably to conveyance of irritating matter by the hands.
After the precaution of wearing gloves was adopted the
affection disappeared.</p>

<p>A marked case of poisoning by nitrous fumes even is
recorded in the manufacture of artificial manure from mixing
Chili saltpetre with a very acid superphosphate.</p>

<p>Injurious fumes can be given off in the rooms where
bones are stored and, in the absence of efficient ventilation,
carbonic acid gas can accumulate to an amount that may be
dangerous.</p>

<p>The fine dust produced in the grinding of <i>basic slag</i> has,
if inhaled, a markedly corrosive action on the respiratory
mucous membrane attributed by some to the high proportion
(about 50 per cent.) in it of quicklime. As a matter of fact
numerous small ulcers are found on the mucous membranes of
basic slag grinders and ulceration of the lung tissue has been
observed. The opinion is expressed that this is due to corrosive
action of the dust itself, and not merely to the sharp, jagged
edged particles of dust inhaled. And in support of this view is
cited the frequency with which epidemics of pneumonia have
been noted among persons employed in basic slag works.
Thus in Nantes thirteen cases of severe pneumonia followed one
another in quick succession. And similar association has been
noted in Middlesbrough, where the action of the basic slag dust
was believed to injure the lung tissue and therefore to provide
a favourable soil for the development of the pneumonia
bacillus. Statistics collected by the Imperial Health Office
showed that in the three years 1892, 1893, and 1894, 91·1 per
cent., 108·9 per cent., and 91·3 per cent. respectively of the
workers became ill, the proportion of respiratory diseases
being 56·4 per cent., 54·4 per cent., and 54·3 per cent. respectively.
A case of severe inflammation of the lungs is described
in a labourer scattering basic slag in a high wind which drove
some of it back in his face.</p>

<p>Lewin has described a case in which a worker scattering a
mixture of basic slag and ammonium superphosphate suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from an eczematous ulceration which, on being scratched by
the patient, became infected and led to death from general
blood poisoning. Lewin regarded the fatal issue as the
sequela of the scattering of the manure.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the conjunctiva and of the eyelids has
been recorded.</p>

<h4>CHROMIUM COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USES</h4>

<p>Chrome ironstone, lime, and soda are ground and intimately
mixed. They are next roasted in reverberatory furnaces,
neutral <i>sodium chromate</i> being formed. This is lixiviated and
converted into sodium bichromate (Na₂Cr₂O₇) by treatment
with sulphuric acid. Concentration by evaporation follows;
the concentrated liquor is crystallised in cast-iron tanks.
The crystals are centrifugalised, dried, and packed. <i>Potassium
bichromate</i> may be made in the same way, or, as is
usually the case, out of sodium bichromate and potassium
chloride.</p>

<p>The bichromates are used in the preparation and oxidation
of chrome colours, but their principal use is in dyeing and
calico printing, bleaching palm oil, purifying wood spirit and
brandy, in the preparation of ‘Swedish’ matches, in the
manufacture of glass, in photography, in dyeing, in tanning,
and in oxidation of anthracene to anthraquinone.</p>

<h5>Lead Chromate and Chrome Colours</h5>

<p><i>Chrome yellow</i> is neutral lead chromate (PbCrO₄). It is
obtained by precipitating a solution of potassium bichromate
with lead acetate or lead nitrate, or by digesting the bichromate
solution with lead sulphate, and is used as a paint and in
calico and cloth printing. With Paris or Berlin blue it forms
a <i>chrome green</i>. <i>Chrome orange</i>, i.e. basic lead chromate
(PbCrO₄Pb(OH)₂) is made by adding milk of lime to lead
chromate and boiling.</p>

<p><i>Chromium</i> and <i>chromic acid salts</i> are widely used in dyeing
and printing, both as mordants and oxidising agents and
as dyes (chrome yellow, chrome orange). In mordanting
wool with potassium chromate the wool is boiled in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
potassium chromate solution to which acids such as sulphuric,
lactic, oxalic, or acetic are added.</p>

<p>In dyeing with chrome yellow, for instance, the following
is the process. Cotton wool is saturated with nitrate or
acetate of lead and dried, passed through lime water, ammonia,
or sodium sulphate, and soaked in a warm solution of potassium
bichromate. The yellow is converted into the orange colour by
subsequent passage through milk of lime.</p>

<p><i>Chrome tanning.</i>—This method of producing chrome
leather, first patented in America, is carried out by either the
single or two bath process.</p>

<p>In the two bath process the material is first soaked in a
saturated solution of bichromate and then treated with an acid
solution of thiosulphate (sodium hyposulphite) so as to reduce
completely the chromic acid. The process is completed even
with the hardest skins in from two to three days.</p>

<p>In the single bath method basic chrome salts are used in
highly concentrated form. The skins are passed from dilute
into strong solutions. In this process also tanning is quickly
effected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Among the persons employed in
the bichromate factory of which Leymann has furnished
detailed particulars, the number of sick days was greater
than that among other workers.</p>

<p>Further, <i>erosion of the skin</i> (<i>chrome holes</i>) is characteristic
of the manufacture of bichromates. These are sluggish
ulcers taking a long time to heal. This is the main cause of
the increased general morbidity that has been observed. The
well-known perforation of the septum of the nose without,
however, causing ulterior effects, was observed by Leymann in
all the workers in the factory. This coincides with the opinion
of others who have found the occurrence of chrome holes, and
especially perforation of the septum, as an extraordinarily
frequent occurrence. Many such observations are recorded,<a href="#endnote40" id="endnote-ref40"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a>
and also in workers manufacturing ‘Swedish’ matches. Thus
of 237 bichromate workers, ulcers were present in 107 and
perforation in 87. According to Lewin, who has paid special
attention to the poisonous nature of chromium compounds, they
can act in two ways: first, on the skin and mucous membrane,
where the dust alights, on the alimentary tract by swallowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and on the pharynx by inhalation. Secondly, by absorption
into the blood, kidney disease may result.</p>

<p>The opinion that chromium, in addition to local, can have
constitutional effect is supported by other authorities. Leymann
describes a case of severe industrial chrome poisoning
accompanied by nephritis in a worker who had inhaled and
swallowed much chromate dust in cleaning out a vessel.
Regulations for the manufacture of bichromates (see Part III)
have no doubt improved the condition, but reports still show
that perforation of the septum generally takes place.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that practically all chromium
compounds are not alike poisonous. Chrome ironstone is
non-poisonous, and the potassium and sodium salts are by far
the most poisonous, while the neutral chromate salts and
chromic oxide are only slightly so. Pander found that
bichromates were 100 times as poisonous as the soluble
chromium oxide compounds, and Kunkel is of opinion that
poisonous effect shown by the oxides is attributable to traces
of oxidation into chromic acid.</p>

<p>Lewin, on the other hand, declares in a cautionary notice
for chrome workers generally that all chromium compounds
are poisonous, and therefore all the dyes made from them.<a href="#endnote41" id="endnote-ref41"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> </p>

<p>In the manufacture of bichromates, chance of injury to
health arises partly from the dust, and partly from the steam,
generated in pouring water over the molten mass. The steam
carries particles of chromium compounds with it into the air.
In evaporating the chromate solutions, preparation of the
bichromate, breaking the crystals, drying and packing, the
workers come into contact with the substance and the liquors.
Chrome ulceration is, therefore, most frequently found among
those employed in the crystal room and less among the furnace
hands.</p>

<p>From 3·30 to 6·30 mg. of bichromate dust have been found
in 1 c.m. of air at breathing level in the room where chromate
was crushed, and 1·57 mg. where it was packed. Further,
presence of chromium in the steam escaping from the hot
chrome liquors has been proved.<a href="#endnote42" id="endnote-ref42"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> </p>

<p>Poisoning from use of chrome colours is partly attributable
to lead, as, for example, in making yellow coloured tape
measures, yellow stamps, and from the use of coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
thread. Gazaneuve<a href="#endnote43" id="endnote-ref43"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> found 10 per cent. of lead chromate
in such thread, in wool 18 per cent., and in the dust of
rooms where such yarn was worked up 44 per cent.</p>

<p>Use of chrome colours and mordants is accompanied by
illness which certainly is referable to the poisonous nature of
the chrome. In France use of chromic and phosphoric acid in
etching zinc plates has caused severe ulceration.</p>

<p>Bichromate poisoning has been described among photographers
in Edinburgh in the process of carbon printing, in
which a bichromate developer is used.<a href="#endnote44" id="endnote-ref44"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> </p>

<p>There is much evidence as to occurrence of skin eruptions
and development of pustular eczema of the hands and forearms
of workers in chrome tanneries.<a href="#endnote45" id="endnote-ref45"><span class="endnote-marker">6</span></a> In a large leather factory
where 300 workers were constantly employed in chrome
tanning nineteen cases of chrome ulceration were noted within
a year. Injury to health was noted in a chrome tannery in
the district of Treves, where the two bath process was used,
from steam developed in dissolving the chromate in hot
water.</p>

<p>Finally, I have found several records in 1907 and 1908 of
perforation of the septum in Bohemian glass workers.</p>

<h4>MANGANESE COMPOUNDS</h4>

<p>The raw material of the manganese industry is <i>hausmannite</i>
(manganese dioxide, MnO₂). This is subjected to a crushing
process, sorted, sieved, finely ground, washed, and dried.
The pure finely ground manganese dioxide is much used in the
chemical industry, especially in the recovery of chlorine in
the Weldon process and in the production of <i>potassium permanganate</i>,
which is obtained by melting manganese dioxide with
caustic soda and potassium chlorate or nitre, lixiviation and
introduction of carbonic acid, or better by treatment with
ozone.</p>

<p>Manganese is also used in the production of colours: the
natural and artificial umbers contain it; in glass works it is used
to decolourise glass, and also in the production of coloured
glass and glazes; in the manufacture of stove tiles, and in
the production of driers for the varnish and oil industry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Manganese and compounds of manganese are dangerous when
absorbed into the system as dust.</p>

<p>Already in 1837 nervous disorders had been described in
workmen who ground manganese dioxide.<a href="#endnote46" id="endnote-ref46"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> The malady was
forgotten, until Jaksch<a href="#endnote47" id="endnote-ref47"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> in Prague in 1901 demonstrated several
such cases in persons employed in a large chemical factory in
Bohemia, from the drying of Weldon mud. In the same
year three similar cases were also described in Hamburg.<a href="#endnote48" id="endnote-ref48"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> In
1902 Jaksch observed a fresh case of poisoning, and in the
factory in question described a condition of manganophobia
among the workers, obviously hysterical, in which symptoms
of real manganese poisoning were simulated. In all some
twenty cases are known. Jaksch is of opinion that it is
manganese dust rich in manganese protoxide that is alone
dangerous, since, if the mud has been previously treated with
hydrochloric acid, by which the lower oxides are removed, no
illness can be found. The most dangerous compounds are
MnO and Mn₃O₄.</p>

<h4>PETROLEUM</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Occurrence and Uses.</span>—Crude petroleum flows spontaneously
from wells in consequence of high internal pressure of
gas or is pumped up. In America and Russia also it is conveyed
hundreds of miles in conduits to the ports to be led
into tank steamers.</p>

<p>The crude oil is a dark-coloured liquid which, in the case
of Pennsylvanian mineral oil, consists mainly of a mixture of
hydrocarbons of the paraffin series, or, in Baku oil, of those of
the naphtha series. There are in addition sulphur compounds,
olefines, pyridin, &amp;c. The crude oil is unsuitable for illuminating
purposes and is subjected to a distillation process. It is
split up into three fractions by a single distillation, namely,
(<i>a</i>) benzines (boiling-point 150° C.), (<i>b</i>) lighting oil (boiling-point
150°-300° C.); at a temperature of 300° C. the distillation is
stopped so that (<i>c</i>) the residuum boiling above 300° C. remains.
Distillation is effected (in America) in large stills, in which
periodically benzine and lighting oil up to 300° C. is distilled and
the residuum run off. In Baku continuously working batteries
of so-called cylindrical boilers are used, into which the crude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
oil streams. In the first set of boilers, the temperature in
which rises to 150° C., the benzine is distilled off, and in the
succeeding ones, heated to 300° C., the illuminating petroleum
oils (kerosine), the residuum flowing continually away.</p>

<p>The <i>mineral oil residues</i> are used as fuel. Heating by
this means, tried first only in Russia, is spreading, especially
for the heating of boilers, in which case the liquid fuel is
blown in generally as a spray. The combustion if rightly
planned is economical and almost smokeless.</p>

<p>The American oil residuum, rich in paraffin, is distilled, the
distillate is cooled and separated by pressure into solid paraffin
and liquid oil. The latter and the Russian mineral oil residues
which are free from paraffin are widely used as lubricants.
In the production of lubricants the residues are distilled at
low temperature (in vacuo or by aid of superheated steam) and
separated into various qualities by fractional cooling, are then
purified with sulphuric acid, and finally washed with caustic
soda solution.</p>

<p>In the preparation of vaseline the residum is not distilled,
but purified only with fuming sulphuric acid and decolourised
with animal charcoal.</p>

<p>The <i>illuminating oil</i> is next subjected to a purifying process
(refining); it is first treated with sulphuric acid and well
agitated by means of compressed air. The acid laden with the
impurities is drawn off below, and the oil freed from acid by
washing first with caustic soda and subsequently with water.
It is then bleached in the sun. For specially fine and high
flash point petroleum the oil undergoes a further distillation
and purification with acid.</p>

<p>The fractions of crude petroleum with low boiling-point
(under 150° C.) are known commercially as raw <i>benzine</i> or
<i>petrol naphtha</i>. It is used for cleaning, in extraction of fats
and oils, and for benzine motors.</p>

<p>Frequently raw benzine is subjected to a purifying process
and to fractional distillation. Purification is carried out by
means of sulphuric acid and soda liquor and subsequent
separation into three fractions and a residue which remains in
the retort—(<i>a</i>) <i>petroleum ether</i> (called gasoline, canadol, and
rhigoline), which comes over between 40° and 70° C., and serves
for carburetting water gas and other similar gases, as a solvent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for resin, oil, rubber, &amp;c.; (<i>b</i>) <i>purified benzine</i> (70°-120° C.) is
used as motor spirit and in chemical cleaning; (<i>c</i>) <i>ligroine</i>
(120°-135° C.), used for illuminating purposes; and (<i>d</i>) the
<i>residual oil</i> (above 135° C.) serves for cleaning machinery and,
especially, as a solvent for lubricating oil, and instead of
turpentine in the production of lacquers, varnishes, and oil
colours.</p>

<p>In <i>chemical cleaning</i> works benzine is used in closed-in
washing apparatus, after which the clothes are centrifugalised
and dried. In view of the risk of fire in these manipulations,
originating mainly from frictional electricity, various substances
are recommended to be added to the benzine, of which
the best known is that recommended by Richter, consisting of
a watery solution of oleate of sodium or magnesium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Industrial poisoning in the petroleum
industry is attributable to the gases given off from
crude petroleum or its products and to inhalation of naphtha
dust. Poisoning occurs principally in the recovery of petroleum
and naphtha from the wells, in storage and transport (in
badly ventilated tanks on board ship, and in entering petroleum
tanks), in the refinery in cleaning out petroleum stills
and mixing vessels, and in emptying out the residues. Further
cases occur occasionally from use of benzine in chemical
cleaning.</p>

<p>In addition to poisoning the injurious effect of petroleum
and its constituents on the skin must be borne in mind.
Opinion is unanimous that this injurious action of mineral oil
is limited to the petroleum fractions with high boiling-point
and especially petroleum residues.</p>

<p>Statistics officially collected in Prussia show the general
health of petroleum workers to be favourable. These statistics
related to 1380 persons, of whom forty-three were suffering
from symptoms attributable to their occupation. Of these
forty-three, nine only were cases of poisoning, the remainder
being all cases of petroleum acne.</p>

<p>The conditions also in French refineries from statistics
collected in the years 1890-1903 seem satisfactory. Eighteen
cases of petroleum acne were reported, eleven of which occurred
at the paraffin presses, five in cleaning out the still residues,
and two were persons filling vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The conditions are clearly less favourable in the Russian
petroleum industry.<a href="#endnote49" id="endnote-ref49"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> </p>

<p>The workers at the naphtha wells suffer from acute and
chronic affections of the respiratory organs. Those suffer
most who cover the wells with cast iron plates to enable the
flow of naphtha to be regulated and led into the reservoirs.
In doing this they inhale naphtha spray.</p>

<p>Lewin<a href="#endnote50" id="endnote-ref50"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> describes cases of severe poisoning with fatal issue
among American workers employed in petroleum tanks. One
man who wished to examine an outlet pipe showed symptoms
after only two minutes. Weinberger describes severe poisoning
of two workers engaged in cleaning out a vessel containing
petroleum residue.</p>

<p>Interesting particulars are given of the effect of petroleum
emanations on the health of the men employed in the petroleum
mines of Carpathia, among whom respiratory affections were
rarely found, but poisoning symptoms involving unconsciousness
and cerebral symptoms frequently. These experiences
undoubtedly point to differing physiological effects of different
kinds of naphtha.</p>

<p>This is supported by the view expressed by Sharp in
America that different kinds of American petroleum have
different effects on the health of the workers, which can be
easily credited from the different chemical composition of crude
naphthas. Thus in Western Virginia, where a natural heavy
oil is obtained, asphyxia from the gas is unknown, although
transient attacks of headache and giddiness may occur, whereas in
Ohio, where light oils are obtained, suffocative attacks are not
infrequent. And it is definitely stated that some naphtha
products irritate the respiratory passages, while others affect
the central nervous system.<a href="#endnote51" id="endnote-ref51"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> </p>

<p>The authors mentioned refer to occurrence of cases of
poisoning in the refining of naphtha from inhalation of the
vapour of the light oils benzine and gasoline. Fatal cases have
been recorded in badly ventilated workrooms in which the
products of distillation are collected. Workers constantly
employed in these rooms develop chronic poisoning, which
is reported also in the case of women employed with
benzine. Intoxication is frequently observed, it is stated,
among the workmen employed in cleaning out the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
tank waggons in which the mineral oils and petroleum are
carried.</p>

<p>Foulerton<a href="#endnote52" id="endnote-ref52"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> describes severe poisoning in a workman who
had climbed into a petroleum reservoir, and two similar cases
from entering naphtha tanks are given in the Report of the
Chief Inspector of Factories for 1908. Two fatal cases are
reported by the Union of Chemical Industry in Germany in
1905 in connection with naphtha stills. Such accidents are
hardly possible, except when, through insufficient disconnection
of the still from the further system of pipes, irrespirable
distillation gases pass backwards into the opened still where
persons are working. Ordinary cocks and valves, therefore, do
not afford sufficient security. Thus, several workers engaged
in repairing a still were rendered unconscious by gases drawn
in from a neighbouring still, and were only brought round after
oxygen inhalation.</p>

<p>Gowers describes a case of chronic poisoning following on
frequent inhalation of gases given off from a petroleum motor,
the symptoms being slurring speech, difficulty of swallowing, and
weakness of the orbicularis and facial muscles. Gowers believed
this to be petroleum gas poisoning (from incomplete combustion),
especially as the symptoms disappeared on giving up
the work, only to return on resuming it again.<a href="#endnote53" id="endnote-ref53"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> </p>

<p>Girls employed in glove cleaning and rubber factories are
described as having been poisoned by benzine.<a href="#endnote54" id="endnote-ref54"><span class="endnote-marker">6</span></a> Poisoning
of chauffeurs is described by several writers.<a href="#endnote55" id="endnote-ref55"><span class="endnote-marker">7</span></a> </p>

<p>Recent literature<a href="#endnote56" id="endnote-ref56"><span class="endnote-marker">8</span></a> tends to show marked increase in the
number of cases of poisoning from greater demand for benzine
as a motive power for vehicles. Such cases have been
observed in automobile factories, and are attributable to the
hydrocarbons of low boiling-point which are present as
impurities in benzine.</p>

<p>A worker in a paraffin factory had entered an open benzine
still to scrape the walls free of crusts containing benzine. He
was found unconscious and died some hours later. It appeared
that he had been in the still several hours, having probably been
overcome to such an extent by the fumes as to be unable
to effect his escape.</p>

<p>Attempt to wipe up benzine spilt in the storage cellar of a
large chemical cleaning works resulted in poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>A night worker in a bone extracting works having turned
on the steam, instead of watching the process fell asleep on a
bench. In consequence the apparatus became so hot that the
solder of a stop valve melted, allowing fumes to escape. The
man was found dead in the morning. In a carpet cleaning
establishment three workers lost consciousness and were found
senseless on the floor. They recovered on inhalation of oxygen.</p>

<p>One further case reported from the instances of benzine
poisoning collected recently<a href="#endnote57" id="endnote-ref57"><span class="endnote-marker">9</span></a> is worth quoting. A worker in a
chemical factory was put to clean a still capable of distilling
2500 litres of benzine. It contained remains of a previous
filling. As soon as he had entered the narrow opening he
became affected and fell into the benzine; he was carried
unconscious to the hospital, his symptoms being vomiting,
spastic contraction of the extremities, cyanosis, weak pulse,
and loss of reflexes, which disappeared an hour and a half later.</p>

<p>The occurrence of skin affections in the naphtha industry
has been noted by several observers, especially among those
employed on the unpurified mineral oils. Eruptions on the
skin from pressing out the paraffin and papillomata (warty
growths) in workers cleaning out the stills are referred to by
many writers,<a href="#endnote58" id="endnote-ref58"><span class="endnote-marker">10</span></a> Ogston in particular.</p>

<p>Recent literature refers to the occurrence of petroleum
eczema in a firebrick and cement factory. The workers
affected had to remove the bricks from moulds on to which
petroleum oil dropped. An eczematous condition was produced
on the inner surface of the hands, necessitating abstention
from work. The pustular eczema in those employed only
a short time in pressing paraffin in the refineries of naphtha
factories is referred to as a frequent occurrence. Practically
all the workers in three refineries in the district of
Czernowitz were affected. The view that it is due to
insufficient care in washing is supported by the report of the
factory inspector in Rouen, that with greater attention in this
matter on the part of the workers marked diminution in its
occurrence followed.</p>

<h4>SULPHUR</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Recovery and Use.</span>—Sulphur, which is found principally
in Sicily (also in Spain, America, and Japan), is obtained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
melting. In Sicily this is carried out in primitive fashion by
piling the rock in heaps, covering them with turf, and setting
fire to them. About a third of the sulphur burns and escapes
as sulphur dioxide, while the remainder is melted and collects
in a hole in the ground.</p>

<p>The crude sulphur thus wastefully produced is purified by
distillation in cast-iron retorts directly fired. It comes on the
market as stick or roll sulphur or as flowers of sulphur.</p>

<p>Further sources for recovery of sulphur are the Leblanc
soda residues (see Soda Production), from which the sulphur
is recovered by the Chance-Claus process, and the gas purifying
material (containing up to 40 per cent.), from which the sulphur
can be recovered by carbon bisulphide (see Illuminating Gas
Industry).</p>

<p>The health conditions of the Sicilian sulphur workers are
very unsatisfactory, due, however, less to the injurious effect
of the escaping gases (noxious alike to the surrounding vegetation)
than to the wretched social conditions, over exertion, and
under feeding of these workers.</p>

<p>Of importance is the risk to health from sulphuretted
hydrogen gas, from sulphur dioxide in the recovery of sulphur
from the soda residues, and from carbon bisulphide in the
extraction of sulphur from the gas purifying material.</p>

<h4>SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS</h4>

<p>Sulphuretted hydrogen gas is used in the chemical industry
especially for the precipitation of copper in the nickel and
cobalt industry, in de-arsenicating acid (see Hydrochloric and
Sulphuric Acids), to reduce chrome salts in the leather industry,
&amp;c. In addition it arises as a product of decomposition in
various industries, such as the Leblanc soda process, in the
preparation of chloride of antimony, in the decomposition of
barium sulphide (by exposure to moist air), in the treatment
of gas liquors, and in the preparation of carbon
bisulphide: it is present in blast furnace gas, is generated in
mines (especially in deep seams containing pyrites), arises
in tar distillation, from use of gas lime in tanning, and in
the preparation and use of sodium sulphide: large quantities
of the gas are generated in the putrefactive processes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
connected with organic sulphur-containing matter such as glue
making, bone stores, storage of green hides, in the decomposition
of waste water in sugar manufacture and brewing,
in the retting of flax, and especially in sewers and middens.</p>

<p>Both <i>acute</i> and <i>chronic</i> poisoning are described.</p>

<p>The following case is reported by the Union of Chemical
Industry in 1907: Three plumbers who were employed on the
night shift in a chemical factory and had gone to sleep in a
workroom were found in a dying condition two hours later.
In the factory barium sulphide solution in a series of large
saturating vessels was being converted into barium carbonate
by forcing in carbonic acid gas; the sulphuretted hydrogen
gas evolved was collected in a gasometer, burnt, and utilised
for manufacture of sulphuric acid. In the saturating vessels
were test cocks, the smell from which enabled the workers to
know whether all the sulphuretted hydrogen gas had been
driven out. If this was so the contents of the retort were
driven by means of carbonic acid gas into a subsidiary vessel,
and the vessel again filled with barium sulphide liquor. From
these intermediate vessels the baryta was pumped into filter
presses, the last remains of sulphuretted hydrogen gas being
carried away by a fan into a ventilating shaft. The subsidiary
vessel and ventilating shaft were situated in front of the
windows of the repairing shop. On the night in question a
worker had thoughtlessly driven the contents out of one
saturating vessel before the sulphuretted hydrogen gas had
been completely removed, and the driving belt of the fan
was broken. Consequently, the sulphuretted hydrogen gas
escaping from the subsidiary vessel entered through the
windows of the workshop and collected over the floor where
the victims of the unusual combination of circumstances slept.</p>

<p>In another chemical works two workers suffered from
severe poisoning in the barium chloride department. The
plant consisted of a closed vat which, in addition to the
openings for admitting the barium sulphide liquor and sulphuric
acid, had a duct with steam injector connected with
the chimney for taking away the sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
Owing to a breakdown the plant was at a standstill, as a
result of which the ventilating duct became blocked by ice.
When the plant was set in motion again the sulphuretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
hydrogen gas escaped through the sulphuric acid opening.
One of the workers affected remained for two days unconscious.<a href="#endnote59" id="endnote-ref59"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> </p>

<p>The report of the Union of Chemical Industry for 1905
cites a case where an agitating vessel, in which, by action
of acid on caustic liquor, sulphuretted hydrogen gas was given
off and drawn away by a fan, had to be stopped to repair one of
the paddles. The flow of acid and liquor was stopped, and the
cover half removed. The deposit which had been precipitated
had to be got rid of next in order to liberate the agitator. The
upper portion of the vessel was washed out with water, and
since no further evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen was
possible from any manufacturing process, the work of removing
the deposit was proceeded with. After several bucketfuls had
been emptied the man inside became unconscious and died.
The casualty was no doubt due to small nests of free caustic
and acid which the spading brought into contact and subsequent
developement of sulphuretted hydrogen afresh. A case
is reported of sulphuretted hydrogen poisoning in a man
attending to the drains in a factory tanning leather by a quick
process. Here, when sulphurous acid acts on sodium sulphide,
sulphuretted hydrogen is given off. In cleaning out a trap
close to the discharge outlet of a tannery two persons were
rendered unconscious, and the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen
was shown by the blackening of the white lead paint
on a house opposite and by the odour.<a href="#endnote60" id="endnote-ref60"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> </p>

<p>In the preparation of ammonium salts Eulenberg<a href="#endnote61" id="endnote-ref61"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> cites
several cases where the workers fell as though struck down,
although the processes were carried on in the open air. They
quickly recovered when removed from the spot.</p>

<p>Oliver cites the case where, in excavating soil for a dock,
four men succumbed in six weeks; the water contained 12 vols.
per cent. of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently acute poisoning symptoms result to
sewer men. Probably sulphuretted hydrogen gas is not wholly
responsible for them, nor for the chronic symptoms complained
of by such workers (inflammation of the conjunctiva, bronchial
catarrh, pallor, depression).</p>

<p>In the distillation processes connected with the paraffin
industry fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h4>CARBON BISULPHIDE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Manufacture.</span>—Carbon bisulphide is prepared by passing
sulphur vapour over pure coal brought to a red heat in cast-iron
retorts into which pieces of sulphur are introduced. The
crude carbon bisulphide requires purification from sulphur,
sulphuretted hydrogen, and volatile organic sulphur compounds
by washing with lime water and subsequent distillation.</p>

<p>Use is made of it principally in the extraction of fat and
oil from bones and oleaginous seeds (cocoanut, olives, &amp;c.),
for vulcanising, and as a solvent of rubber. It is used also
to extract sulphur from gas purifying material and for the
preparation of various chemical substances (ammonium
sulphocyanide, &amp;c.), as well as for the destruction of pests
(phylloxera and rats).</p>

<p>Fat and oil are extracted from seeds, bones, &amp;c., by carbon
bisulphide, benzine, or ether, and, to avoid evaporation, the
vessels are as airtight as possible and arranged, as a rule, for
continuous working.</p>

<p><i>Vulcanisation</i> is the rendering of rubber permanently
elastic by its combination with sulphur. It is effected by
means of chloride of sulphur, sulphide of barium, calcium,
or antimony, and other sulphur-containing compounds, heat
and pressure, or by a cold method consisting in the dipping
of the formed objects in a mixture of carbon bisulphide
and chloride of sulphur. The process of manufacture is
briefly as follows: The raw material is first softened and
washed by hot water and kneading in rolls. The washed
and dried rubber is then mixed on callender rolls with various
ingredients, such as zinc white, chalk, white lead, litharge,
cinnabar, graphite, rubber substitutes (prepared by boiling
vegetable oils, to which sulphur has been added, with chloride
of sulphur). In vulcanising by aid of heat the necessary
sulphur or sulphur compound is added. Vulcanisation with
sulphur alone is only possible with aid of steam and mechanical
pressure in various kinds of apparatus according to the
nature of the article produced. In the cold vulcanisation
process the previously shaped articles are dipped for a few
seconds or minutes in the mixture of carbon bisulphide and
chloride of sulphur and subsequently dried in warm air as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In view of the poisonous nature of carbon bisulphide,
benzine is much used now. In the cold method use of chloride
of sulphur in benzine can replace it altogether.</p>

<p>Instead of benzine other solvents are available—chlorine
substitution products of methane (dichlormethane, carbon
tetrachloride). In other processes <i>rubber solvents</i> are largely
used, for instance, acetone, oil of turpentine, petroleum
benzine, ether, and benzene. Rubber solutions are used for
waterproofing cloth and other materials.</p>

<p>Similar to the preparation and use of rubber is that of
guttapercha. But vulcanisation is easier by the lead and
zinc thiosulphate process than by the methods used in the
case of rubber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health of CS₂ and Other Dangers to
Health in the Rubber Industry.</span>—In the manufacture of
carbon bisulphide little or no danger is run either to health
or from fire.</p>

<p>In the rubber trade the poisonous nature of <i>benzine</i> and
<i>chloride of sulphur</i> have to be borne in mind, and also the
considerable risk of <i>lead poisoning</i> in mixing. Cases of plumbism,
especially in earlier years, are referred to.<a href="#endnote62" id="endnote-ref62"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> </p>

<p><i>Benzine</i> poisoning plays only a secondary part in the rubber
industry. No severe cases are recorded, only slight cases
following an inhalation of fumes.</p>

<p>Cases of poisoning are recorded in a motor tyre factory
in Upsala.<a href="#endnote63" id="endnote-ref63"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> Nine women were affected, of whom four died.
Whether these cases were due to benzene or petroleum
benzine is not stated. It is remarkable that two such very
different substances as benzene and benzine should be so easily
confused.</p>

<p>But that in the rubber industry cases of benzene poisoning
do actually occur is proved by the following recent cases:
Rubber dissolved in benzol was being laid on a spreading
machine in the usual way. Of three men employed one was
rendered unconscious and died.<a href="#endnote64" id="endnote-ref64"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> </p>

<p>In a rubber recovery process a worker was rendered unconscious
after entering a benzol still, also two others who sought
to rescue him. Only one was saved.</p>

<p>Cases of aniline poisoning are reported where aniline is
used for extracting rubber.<a href="#endnote65" id="endnote-ref65"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> </p>

<p><i>Chloride of sulphur</i>, by reason of its properties and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
readiness with which it decomposes (see Chloride of Sulphur),
causes annoyance to rubber workers, but rarely poisoning.</p>

<p>Much importance attaches to <i>chronic carbon bisulphide
poisoning</i> in the rubber industry. Many scientists have
experimented as to its poisonous nature (see especially on this
Part II, p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a>).</p>

<p>Lehmann’s<a href="#endnote66" id="endnote-ref66"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> experiments show that a proportion of 0·50-0·7
mg. of CS₂ per litre of air causes hardly any symptoms;
1·0-1·2 mg. slight effects which become more marked on
continued exposure; 1·5 mg. produces severe symptoms.
About 1·0 mg. per litre of air is the amount which may set up
chronic effects. In vulcanising rooms this limit may easily be
exceeded unless special preventive measures are adopted.</p>

<p>Laudenheimer<a href="#endnote67" id="endnote-ref67"><span class="endnote-marker">6</span></a> has made several analyses of the proportion
of CS₂ in workrooms. Thus 0·9-1·8 mg. per litre of air were
found in a room where pouches were vulcanised; 0·5-2·4 mg.
were aspirated one-half metre distant from the dipping vessels;
and 0·18-0·27 mg. in the room for making ‘baby comforters.’</p>

<p>In analyses made some years ago proportions of 2·9-5·6 mg.
were obtained.</p>

<p>Although literature contains many references to CS₂
poisoning, too much importance ought not to be attached to
them now in view of the arrangements in modern well-equipped
vulcanising premises. Laudenheimer has collected particulars
of 31 cases of brain, and 19 of nervous, diseases among 219
persons coming into contact with CS₂ between 1874 and
1908, all of whom had been medically attended. In the last
ten years, however, the psychical symptoms were seven times
less than in the preceding period. Between 1896 and 1898 the
average proportion of brain disease in the vulcanising department
was 1·95 per cent., and of nervous diseases 0·22 per
cent., as compared with 0·92 per cent. and 0·03 per cent. in
the textile. Moreover, he maintains that practically all
workers who come at all into contact with CS₂ must be to
some extent affected injuriously by it.</p>

<p>Studies on the injurious nature of CS₂ date from the years
1851-60, when the French writers Pazen, Duchenne, Beaugrand,
Piorry, &amp;c., came across cases from the Parkes’ process
(cold vulcanisation by means of CS₂ and SCl₂). Delpech<a href="#endnote68" id="endnote-ref68"><span class="endnote-marker">7</span></a>
published in 1860 and 1863 details of twenty-four severe cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in rubber workers, some of which were fatal, and at the same
time described the pitiable conditions under which the work
was carried on.</p>

<p>In Germany Hermann, Hirt and Lewin, and Eulenberg
dealt with the subject, but their work is more theoretical in
character; and in Laudenheimer’s work referred to the
histories of several cases are given in detail.</p>

<p>Mention should be made of the injury caused to the skin
by the fluids used in extraction of fat and in vulcanising—especially
by benzine and carbon bisulphide. Perrin considers
the effect due partly to the withdrawal of heat and
partly to the solvent action on the natural grease, producing
an unpleasant feeling of dryness and contraction of the skin.</p>

<h4>ILLUMINATING GAS</h4>

<p>Illuminating gas is obtained by the dry distillation of coal.
The products of distillation are subjected on the gasworks to
several purifying processes, such as condensation in coolers,
moist and dry purifying, from which valuable bye-products
(such as tar, ammonia, cyanogen compounds) are obtained.
The purified gas is stored in gas holders containing on an
average 49 per cent. hydrogen, 34 per cent. methane, 8 per cent.
carbonic oxide, 1 per cent. carbon dioxide, 4 per cent. nitrogen,
and about 4 per cent. of the heavy hydrocarbons (ethylene,
benzene vapour, acetylene, and their homologues) to which the
illuminating properties are almost exclusively due.</p>

<p>The most important stages in its preparation will be shortly
described. <i>Distillation</i> is effected in cylindrical, usually horizontal,
fireclay retorts placed in a group or setting (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>),
which formerly were heated by coke but in modern works
always by gas. Charging with coal and removal of the coke
takes place about every four hours, often by means of
mechanical contrivances.</p>

<p>Iron pipes conduct the products of distillation to the
<i>hydraulic main</i>. This is a long covered channel extending the
entire length of the stack and receiving the gas and distillate
from each retort. In it the greater part of the tar and of
the ammoniacal water condense and collect under the water
which is kept in the main to act as a seal to the ends of the dip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
pipes, to prevent the gas from passing back into the retort
when the latter is opened. While the liquid flows from the
hydraulic main into cisterns, the gas passes into <i>coolers</i> or
<i>condensers</i>, tall iron cylinders, in which, as the result of air
and water cooling, further portions of the tar and ammoniacal
liquor are condensed. To free it still more from particles
of tar the gas passes through the <i>tar separator</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="fig11">

<img src="images/fig11.jpg" width="500" height="475" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>—Manufacture of Illuminating Gas. Horizontal fireclay retorts placed in
a setting and heated by gas(<i>after Ost</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>The tar which remains behind flows through a tube to the
cistern. From the tar separator the gas goes through <i>scrubbers</i>
(<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>), where the gas is washed free of ammonia and part of
the sulphuretted hydrogen and carbon dioxide with water.
The scrubbers are tower-like vessels filled with coke or charcoal
through which the gas passes from below upwards, encountering
a spray of water. Several scrubbers in series are used, so that
the water constantly becomes richer in ammonia. Mechanical
scrubbers are much used, so-called standard washers; they are
rotating, horizontal cylinders having several chambers filled
with staves of wood half dipping in water. In them the same
principle of making the gas meet an opposing stream of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
is employed, so that the last traces of ammonia are removed
from the gas.</p>

<p>The various purifying apparatus through which the gas has
to pass cause considerable resistance to its flow. Escape in
various ways would occur had the gas to overcome it by its own
pressure, and too long contact of the gas with the hot walls
of the retorts would be detrimental. Hence an exhauster is
applied to the system which keeps the pressure to the right
proportion in the retorts and drives on the gas.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="fig12">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—Washer or Scrubber</p>

</div>

<p>After purification in the scrubbers <i>dry purification</i> follows,
having for its object especially removal of compounds of sulphur
and cyanogen and carbon dioxide. To effect this several
shallow receptacles are used, each having a false bottom
upon which the purifying material is spread out. The boxes
are so arranged that the gas first passes through purifying
material which is almost saturated and finally through fresh
material, so that the material becomes richer in sulphur and
cyanogen compounds. The <i>gas purifying material</i> formerly
used was slaked lime, and it is still frequently used, but more
generally bog iron ore or artificially prepared mixtures are used
consisting mostly of oxide of iron. The saturated purifying
material is regenerated by oxidation on spreading it out in the
air and turning it frequently. After having been thus treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
some ten times the mass contains 50 per cent. sulphur, and
13 to 14 per cent. ferrocyanide.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>naphthalene</i> in illuminating gas does not separate in
the condenser, and therefore is generally treated in special
apparatus by washing the gas
with heavy coal tar.</p>

<p>The gas purified, as has
been described, is measured by
a meter and stored in gasometers.
These are bells made
up of sheet iron which hang
down into walled receptacles
filled with water to act as a
water seal, and are raised by
the pressure of the gas which
streams into them. The gas
passes to the network of
mains by pressure of the
weight of the gasometer, after
having passed through a pressure
regulating apparatus.</p>

industry, see the sections on

Tar, Benzene, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effect on Health.</span>—Opinions
differ as to the effect
on health which employment
in gas works exerts. This is
true of old as well as of modern
literature.</p>

<p>Hirt<a href="#endnote69" id="endnote-ref69"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> maintains that gas
workers suffer no increase in
illness because of their employment.
They reach, he says, a
relatively high age and their mortality he puts down at from
0·5 to 1 per cent. (my own observations make me conclude that
the average mortality among persons insured in sick societies
in Bohemia is 1 per cent., so that Hirt’s figure is not high).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Layet<a href="#endnote70" id="endnote-ref70"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> agreed with Hirt, but was of opinion that gas
workers suffered from anæmia and gastro-intestinal symptoms
attributable to inhalation of injurious gases. The sudden
symptoms of intoxication, ‘exhaustion and sinking suddenly
into a comatose condition,’ which he attributes to the effect of
hydrocarbons and sulphuretted hydrogen gas, may well have
been the symptoms of carbonic oxide poisoning.</p>

<p>Goldschmidt<a href="#endnote71" id="endnote-ref71"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> in recent literature considers manufacture
of illuminating gas by no means dangerous or unhealthy, and
speaks of no specific maladies as having been observed by him.
Nevertheless, he admits with Layet that the men employed
in the condensing and purifying processes are constantly in an
atmosphere contaminated by gas, and that the cleaning and
regeneration of the purifying mass is associated with inflammation
of the eyes, violent catarrh, and inflammation of the
respiratory passages, since, on contact of the purifying mass
with the air, hydrocyanic acid gas, sulphocyanic acid gas,
and fumes containing carbolic, butyric, and valerianic acids
are generated.</p>

<p>Other writers<a href="#endnote72" id="endnote-ref72"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> refer to the injurious effects from manipulating
the purifying material. In general, though, they
accept the view, without however producing any figures,
that work in gas works is unattended with serious injury
to health and that poisonings, especially from carbonic oxide,
are rare. Such cases are described,<a href="#endnote73" id="endnote-ref73"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> but the authors are not
quite at one as to the healthiness or otherwise of the industry.
The one opinion is based on study of the sick club reports for
several years of a large gas works employing some 2400 workers
(probably Vienna).<a href="#endnote74" id="endnote-ref74"><span class="endnote-marker">6</span></a> The average frequency of sickness
(sickness percentage), excluding accidents, was 48·7 per cent.
The conclusion is drawn that the health conditions of gas
workers is favourable. It is pointed out, however, that
diseases of the respiratory and digestive organs (12·8 and 10·16
per cent. of the persons employed) are relatively high, and
that the mortality (1·56 per cent.) of gas-workers is higher
than that of other workers. This is attributed to the constant
inhalation of air charged with injurious gases. Work at the
retorts, coke quenching, and attending to the purifying plant
are considered especially unhealthy.</p>

<p>The other figures relate to the Magdeburg gas works;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
they are higher than those quoted. The morbidity of the gas
workers was found to be 68·5 per cent., of which 18 per cent.
was due to disease of the digestive system, 20·5 per cent. to
disease of the respiratory organs, and 1 per cent. to poisoning.
No details of the cases of poisoning are given. Carbonic oxide
poisoning is said to be not infrequent, the injurious effect
of cleaning the purifiers is referred to, and poisoning by inhalation
of ammonia is reported as possible.</p>

<p>Still, no very unfavourable opinion is drawn as to the
nature of the work. The sickness frequency in sick clubs is
about 50 per cent., and even in well-managed chemical works
Leymann has shown it to be from 65 to 80 per cent. The
recently published elaborate statistics of sickness and mortality
of the Leipzig local sickness clubs<a href="#endnote75" id="endnote-ref75"><span class="endnote-marker">7</span></a> contain the following
figures for gas workers: Among 3028 gas workers there were
on an average yearly 2046 cases of sickness, twenty deaths,
and four cases of poisoning. The total morbidity, therefore,
was 67·57 per cent., mortality 0·66 per cent., and the morbidity
from poisoning 0·13 per cent. Diseases of the respiratory
tract equalled 10·63 per cent., of the digestive tract 10·87
per cent., of the muscular system 13·10 per cent., and from
rheumatism 11·10 per cent. These figures, therefore, are not
abnormally high and the poisoning is very low.</p>

<p>Still, industrial cases of poisoning in gas works are recorded.
Of these the most important will be mentioned. Six persons
were employed in a sub-station in introducing a new sliding
shutter into a gas main, with the object of deviating the gas for
the filling of balloons. A regulating valve broke, and the gas
escaped from a pipe 40 cm. in diameter. Five of the men
were rendered unconscious, and resuscitation by means of
oxygen inhalation failed in one case. In repairing the damage
done two other cases occurred.<a href="#endnote76" id="endnote-ref76"><span class="endnote-marker">8</span></a> In emptying a purifier a
worker was killed from failure to shut off the valve.</p>

<p>Besides poisoning from illuminating gas, industrial poisoning
in gas works is described attributable, in part at least, to
ammonia. Thus the report of the factory inspectors of
Prussia for 1904 narrates how a worker became unconscious
while superintending the ammonia water well, fell in, and was
drowned.</p>

<p>A further case is described in the report of the Union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of Chemical Industry for 1904. In the department for concentrating
the gas liquor the foreman and an assistant on the
night shift were getting rid of the residues from a washer
by means of hot water. The cover had been removed, but,
contrary to instructions, the steam had not been shut off.
Ammonia fumes rushed out and rendered both unconscious,
in which condition there were found by the workmen coming
in the morning.<a href="#endnote77" id="endnote-ref77"><span class="endnote-marker">9</span></a> </p>

<p>In the preparation of ammonium sulphate, probably in
consequence of too much steam pressure, gas liquor was
driven into the sulphuric acid receiver instead of ammonia gas.
The receiver overflowed, and ammonia gas escaped in such
quantity as to render unconscious the foreman and two men
who went to his assistance.<a href="#endnote78" id="endnote-ref78"><span class="endnote-marker">10</span></a> </p>

<p>The use of illuminating gas in industrial premises can give
rise to poisoning. Thus the women employed in a scent
factory, where so-called quick gas heaters were used, suffered
from general gas poisoning.<a href="#endnote79" id="endnote-ref79"><span class="endnote-marker">11</span></a> </p>

<p>In Great Britain in 1907 sixteen cases of carbonic
oxide poisoning from use of gas in industrial premises were
reported.</p>

<h4>COKE OVENS</h4>

<p>Coke is obtained partly as a residue in the retorts after
the production of illuminating gas. Such <i>gas coke</i> is unsuitable
for metallurgical purposes, as in the blast furnace. Far
larger quantities of coal are subjected to dry distillation for
metallurgical purposes in coke ovens than in gas works. Hence
their erection close to blast furnaces. In the older form of
coke oven the bye-products were lost. Those generally used
now consist of closed chambers heated from the outside, and
they can be divided into coke ovens which do, and those which
do not, recover the bye-products. These are the same as
those which have been considered under manufacture of
illuminating-gas—tar, ammonia, benzene and its homologues,
cyanogen, &amp;c. In the coke ovens in which the bye-products
are not recovered the gases and tarry vapours escaping
on coking pass into the heating flues, where, brought
into contact with the air blast, they burn and help to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
heat the oven, while what is unused goes to the main chimney
stack.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig14">

apparatus; E Purified gas: F, F´ Air inlets; G G,´ G´´ Combustion
chambers.</p>

</div>

<p>In the modern <i>distillation ovens</i> with recovery of the bye-products
the gases escaping from the coal are led (air being
cut off as completely as possible) through ascending pipes into
the main collector, where they are cooled, and the tarry ingredients
as well as a part of the ammonia are absorbed by
water; subsequently the gases pass through washing apparatus
with a view to as complete a recovery of the ammonia and
benzene as possible. The purified gases are now again led
to the ovens and burnt with access of air in the combustion
chambers between two ovens. Generally these ovens are so
constructed as to act as non-recovery ovens also (especially in
starting the process).</p>

<p>The coal is charged into the ovens through charge holes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the top and brought to a level in the chambers either by hand
or mechanically. Removal of the coke block after completion
of the coking operation is done by a shield attached to a rack and
pinion jack. Afterwards the coke is quenched with water.</p>

<p>Recovery of the <i>bye-products</i> of coke distillation ovens is
similar to the method described for illuminating gas, i.e.
first by condensation with aid of air or water cooling, then
direct washing with water (generally in scrubbers), whereby
tar and ammonia water are recovered. <i>Recovery of benzene</i>
and its homologues (see Benzene later) depends on the fact
that the coke oven gases freed from tar and ammonia are
brought into the closest possible contact with the so-called
wash oils, i.e. coal tar oils with high boiling-point (250-300° C.).
For this purpose several washing towers are employed. The
waste oil enriched with benzene is recovered in stills intermittently
or continuously and used again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Injury to health from work at coke
ovens is similar to that in the manufacture of illuminating
gas. There is the possibility of carbonic oxide poisoning from
escape of gas from leakage in the apparatus. As further
possible sources of danger ammonia, cyanogen and sulpho-cyanogen
compounds, and benzene have to be borne in mind.</p>

<p>In the distillation of the wash oil severe poisoning can
arise, as in a case described, where two men were fatally
poisoned in distilling tar with wash oil.<a href="#endnote80" id="endnote-ref80"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> </p>

<p>The details of the case are not without interest. The
poisoning occurred in the lavatory. The gases had escaped
from the drain through the ventilating shaft next to the closet.
The gases came from distillation of the mixture of tar and
wash oil, and were driven by means of air pumps in such a
way that normally the uncondensed gases made their way to the
chimney stack. On the day of the accident the pumps were
out of use, and the gases were driven by steam injectors into the
drain. Analysis showed the gases to contain much sulphuretted
hydrogen. When this was absorbed, a gas which could be
condensed was obtained containing carbon bisulphide and
hydrocarbons of unknown composition (? benzene). Only
traces of cyanogen and sulpho-cyanogen compounds were
present. Physiological experiment showed that poisoning
was attributable mainly to sulphuretted hydrogen gas, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that after this was removed by absorption a further poisonous
gas remained.</p>

<h4>Other Kinds of Power and Illuminating Gas</h4>

<p><i>Producer gas</i> or <i>generator gas</i>.—Manufacture of producer gas
consists in dealing separately with the generation of the gas
and the combustion of the gases which
arise. This is effected by admitting only
so much air (primary air supply) to the
fuel as is necessary to cause the gases to
come off, and then admitting further air
(secondary supply) at the point where
the combustion is to take place; this
secondary supply and the gas formed in
the gas producer are heated in regenerators
before combustion by bringing
the gases to be burnt into contact with
<i>Siemens’s heaters</i>, of which there are
four. Two of these are always heated
and serve to heat the producer gas and
secondary air supply.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;" id="fig15">

<img src="images/fig15.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>—Horizontal
Regenerative Grate (<i>after
Lueger</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>A producer gas furnace, therefore, consists of a gas
producer, a gas main leading to the
furnace hearth, the heater, and the
chimney.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="fig16">

<img src="images/fig16.jpg" width="300" height="275" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>—Step Regenerative
Grate (<i>after Lueger</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>The gas producer is a combustion
chamber filled with coal in
which the coal in the upper layer
is burnt. Generators may have
horizontal or sloping grate (see
figs. <a href="#fig15">15</a> and <a href="#fig16">16</a>). The <i>Siemens’s</i>
heaters or regenerators are chambers
built of, and filled loosely with, fireclay
bricks and arranged in couples.
Should the gas producers become
too hot, instead of the chambers subdivided air heaters are
used, whereby the hot furnace gases are brought into contact
with a system of thin-walled, gastight fireclay pipes, to
which they give up their heat, while the secondary air supply
for the furnace is led beside these pipes and so becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
heated indirectly. Previous heating of the producer gas is
here not necessary; no valves are needed because the three
streams of gas all pass in the same direction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig17">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17a.</span>—Siemens’s Regenerative Furnace</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17b.</span>—Siemens’s Regenerative Furnace</p>

</div>

<p>Such air heating arrangements are used for heating the
retorts in gas works, for melting the ‘metal’ in glass works, and
very generally in other industries, as they offer many technical
and hygienic advantages. Generator gas from coke contains
34 per cent. carbonic oxide, 0·1 per cent. hydrogen, 1·9 per
cent. carbon dioxide, and 64 per cent. nitrogen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Blast furnace gas.</i>—Blast furnace gas is formed under the
same conditions as have been described for generator gas;
it contains more carbon dioxide (about 10 per cent.). (Further
details are given in the section on Iron—Blast Furnaces.)</p>

<p><i>Water gas.</i>—Water gas is made by the passage of steam
through incandescent coal, according to the equation:</p>

<ul>
<li>C + H₂O = CO + 2H.</li>
</ul>

<p>The iron gas producer, lined with firebrick, is filled with
anthracite or coke and heated by blowing hot air through it.
This causes producer gas to escape, after which steam is blown
through, causing water gas to escape—containing hydrogen and
carbonic oxide to the extent of 45-50 per cent., carbon
dioxide and nitrogen 2-6 per cent., and a little methane.</p>

<p>The blowing of hot air and steam is done alternately, and
both kinds of gas are led away and collected separately, the
water gas being previously purified in scrubbers, condensers,
and purifiers. It serves for the production of high temperatures
(in smelting of metals). Further, when carburetted and
also when carefully purified in an uncarburetted state, it
serves as an illuminant. The producer gas generated at the
same time is used for heating purposes (generally for heating
boilers).</p>

<p><i>Dowson gas.</i>—Dowson gas is obtained by collecting and
storing together the gases produced in the manner described
for water gas. Under the grating of the wrought-iron gas
producer (lined with firebrick and similarly filled with coke or
anthracite) a mixture of air and steam, produced in a special
small boiler, is blown through by means of a Körting’s
injector.</p>

<p>Before storage the gas is subjected to a purifying process
similar to that in the case of water gas. The mixed gas
consists of 1 vol. water gas and 2-3 vols. producer gas, with
about 10-15 vols. per cent. H, 22-27 vols. per cent. CO,
3-6 per cent. CO₂, and 50-55 per cent. N. It is an admirable
power gas for driving gas motors (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p><i>Mond gas</i> similarly is a mixed gas obtained by blowing
much superheated steam into coal at low temperature.
Ammonia is produced at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Suction gas.</i>—In contradistinction to the Dowson system,
in which air mixed with steam is forced into the producer by a
steam injector, in the suction gas plant the air and steam are
drawn into the generator by the apparatus itself. The whole
apparatus while in action is under slight negative pressure. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
special steam boiler is unnecessary because the necessary steam
is got up in a water container surrounding or connected with
the cover of the generator. The plant is set in motion by
setting the fire in action by a fan.</p>

<p><a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a> shows a suction gas plant. B is the fan. Above
the generator A and at the lower part of the feed hopper is an
annular vessel for generating steam, over the surface of which
air is drawn across from the pipe e, passing then through the
pipe f into the ash box g, and then through the incandescent
fuel. The gas produced is purified in the scrubber D, and
passes then through a pipe to the purifier containing sawdust
and to the motor.</p>

<p><i>Carburetted gas.</i>—Gas intended for illuminating purposes is
carburetted to increase its illuminating power, i.e. enriched
with heavy hydrocarbons. Carburetting is effected either by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
hot method—adding the gases distilled from mineral or other
oils—or by a cold method—allowing the gas to come into contact
with cold benzol or benzine. Coal gas as well as water gas
is subjected to the carburetting process, but it has not the same
importance now in relation to illuminating power, as reliance
is more and more being placed on the use of mantles.</p>

<h5>ACETYLENE</h5>

<p><i>Calcium carbide.</i>—Acetylene is prepared from calcium
carbide, which on contact with water gives off acetylene.</p>

<p><i>Calcium carbide</i> is prepared electro-chemically. A mixture
of burnt lime and coke is ground and melted up together at
very high temperature in an electric furnace, in doing which
there is considerable disengagement of carbonic oxide according
to the equation:</p>

<ul>
<li>CaO + 3C = CaC₂ + CO.</li>
</ul>

<p>The furnaces used in the production of calcium carbide are of
different construction. Generally the furnace is of the nature
of an electric arc, and is arranged either as a crucible furnace for
intermittent work or like a blast furnace for continuous work.</p>

<p>Besides these there are resistance furnaces in which the heat
is created by the resistance offered to the passage of the current
by the molten calcium carbide.</p>

<p>The carbonic oxide given off in the process causes
difficulty. In many furnaces it is burnt and so utilised for
heating purposes. The calcium carbide produced contains
as impurities silicon carbide, ferro-silicon, calcium sulphide,
and calcium phosphide.</p>

<p><i>Acetylene</i> (C₂H₂), formed by the decomposition of calcium
carbide by means of water (CaC₂ + 2H₂O = Ca(OH)₂ + C₂H₂),
furnishes when pure an illuminating gas of great brilliancy and
whiteness. Its production is relatively easy. Used for the
purpose are (1) apparatus in which water is made to drop on
the carbide, (2) apparatus in which the carbide dips into water
and is removed automatically on generation of the gas, (3)
apparatus in which the carbide is completely immersed in
water, and (4) apparatus in which the carbide in tiny lumps
is thrown on to water. These are diagrammatically represented
in <a href="#fig20">figs. 20<span class="smcap">a</span> to 20<span class="smcap">d</span></a> .</p>

<p>The most important impurities of acetylene are ammonia,
sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and phosphoretted hydrogen.
Before use, therefore, it is subjected to purification in various
ways. In Wolf’s method the gas is passed through a washer
(with the object of removing ammonia and sulphuretted
hydrogen gas) and a purifying material consisting of chloride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of lime and bichromate salts. In Frank’s method the gas
passes though a system of vessels containing an acid solution
of copper chloride, and also through a washer. Chloride of
lime with sawdust is used as a purifying agent. Finally, the
gas is stored and thence sent to the consumer (<a href="#fig21">see fig. 21</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Almost all the poisoning caused in
the industries in question is due to carbonic oxide gas, of which
water gas contains 41 per cent., generator gas 35 per cent., and
suction and Dowson gas 25 per cent.</p>

<p>That industrial carbonic oxide poisoning is not rare the
reports of the certifying surgeons in Great Britain sufficiently
show. In the year 1906 fifty-five persons are referred to as
having suffered, with fatal issue in four. In 1907 there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
eighty-one, of which ten were fatal. Of the 1906 cases twenty
resulted from inhalation of producer, Mond, or suction gas,
sixteen from coal gas (in several instances containing
carburetted water gas), seventeen from blast furnace gas,
and one each from charcoal fumes from a brazier, and from
the cleaning out of an oil gas holder.</p>

<p>As causes of the poisoning from suction gas were (1) improper
situation of gas plant in cellar or basement, allowing gas to
collect or pass upward; (2) defective fittings; (3) starting the
suction gas plant by the fan with chimney valve closed; (4)
cleaning out ‘scrubbers’ or repairing valves, &amp;c.; (5) defective
gasometer. In the seventeen cases due to blast furnace gas
six were due to conveyance of the gas by the wind from a
flue left open for cleaning purposes into an engineering shed,
two to charging the cupola furnace, two to entering the
furnace, and four to cleaning the flues.</p>

<p>The following are instances taken from recent literature
on gas poisoning<a href="#endnote81" id="endnote-ref81"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> : Several cases of poisoning by <i>water gas</i>
occurred in a smelting works. The poisoning originated
when a blowing machine driven by water gas was started.
Owing to premature opening of the gas valve two men
employed in a well underneath the machine were overcome.
The attendant who had opened the valve succeeded in lifting
both from the well; but as he was trying to lift a third man
who had come to his assistance and fallen into the well he
himself fell in and was overcome. The same fate befell the
engineer and his assistant who came to the rescue. All efforts
to recover the four men by others roped together failed, as all
of them to the number of eight were rendered unconscious.
With the aid of rescue appliances (helmets, &amp;c.) the bodies
were recovered, but efforts at artificial respiration failed.</p>

<p>A workman was killed by <i>suction gas</i> while in the water-closet.
It appeared that some time previously when the plant
was installed the ventilating pipe between the purifier and
motor, instead of being led through the roof, had been led
out sideways on a level with the floor immediately above the
closet.</p>

<p>In another case the suction gas attendant had taken out
the three-way cock between the generator and motor for repairs
and had not reinserted it properly, so that when effort was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
made to start the motor this failed, as gas only and no air was
drawn in. The motor was thought to be at fault, and the fan
was worked so vigorously that the gas forced its way out
through the packing of the flange connections and produced
symptoms of poisoning in the persons employed.</p>

<p>More dangerous than suction gas plants, in which normally
no escape takes place, are installations depending on gas
<i>under pressure</i>. Such an installation was used for heating gas
irons in a Berlin laundry. The arrangements were considered
excellent. The gas jets were in stoves from which the fumes
were exhausted. The gas was made from charcoal and contained
13 per cent. of hydrogen. No trace of carbonic oxide
was found in the ironing room on examination of the air.
After having been in use for months the mechanical ventilation
got out of order, with the result that twelve women suffered
severely from symptoms of carbonic oxide poisoning, from
which they were brought round by oxygen inhalation. The
laundry reverted to the use of illuminating gas. The conclusion
to be drawn is that installations for gas heating are to be used
with caution.<a href="#endnote82" id="endnote-ref82"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> </p>

<p>Industrial poisoning from <i>blast furnace gas</i> is frequent.
Two fatal cases were reported<a href="#endnote83" id="endnote-ref83"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> in men employed in the gas
washing apparatus. They met their death at the manhole
leading to the waste-water outlet. In another case a workman
entered the gas main three hours after the gas had been
cut off to clear it of the dust which had collected. He succumbed,
showing that such accumulations can retain gas for a
long time. Steps had been taken three hours previously to
ventilate the portion of gas main in question.</p>

<p>A fatal case occurred in the cleaning out of a blast furnace
flue which had been ventilated for 1½ hours by opening all
manholes, headplates, &amp;c. The foreman found the deceased
with his face lying in the flue dust; both he and a helper were
temporarily rendered unconscious.</p>

<p>Cases of poisoning by <i>generator gas</i> are described.<a href="#endnote84" id="endnote-ref84"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> A
workman who had entered a gasometer containing the gas
died in ten minutes, and another remained unconscious for
ten days and for another ten days suffered from mental disturbance,
showing itself in hebetude and weakness of memory.</p>

<p><i>Acetylene</i> is poisonous to only a slight extent. Impurities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in it, such as carbon bisulphide, carbonic oxide (present to the
extent of 1-2 per cent.), and especially phosphoretted hydrogen
gas, must be borne in mind.</p>

<p>American calcium carbide<a href="#endnote85" id="endnote-ref85"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> yields acetylene containing
0·04 per cent. of phosphoretted hydrogen; Lunge and Cederkreutz
have found as much as 0·06 per cent. in acetylene.</p>

<h4>AMMONIA AND AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>—Ammonia and ammonium salts are now
exclusively obtained as a bye-product in the dry distillation of
coal, from the ammonia water in gas works, and as a bye-product
from coke ovens.</p>

<p>The ammonia water of gas works contains from 2-3 per
cent. of ammonia, some of which can be recovered on boiling,
but some is in a non-volatile form, and to be recovered the
compound must be decomposed. The volatile compounds
are principally ammonium carbonate and, to a less extent,
ammonium sulphide and cyanide; the non-volatile compounds
are ammonium sulphocyanide, ammonium chloride, sulphate,
thiosulphate, &amp;c. Other noteworthy substances in ammonia
water are pyridine, pyrrol, phenols, hydrocarbons, and tarry
compounds.</p>

<p>Decomposition of the non-volatile compounds is effected
by lime. Hence the ammonia water is distilled first alone,
and then with lime. The distillate is passed into sulphuric
acid, ammonium sulphate being formed. Distillation apparatus
constructed on the principle usual in rectifying spirit
is used, so that continuous action is secured; the ammonia
water flows into the apparatus continuously and is freed of
the volatile compounds by the steam. At a later stage milk
of lime is added, which liberates the ammonia from the nonvolatile
compounds.</p>

<p>Of the ammonium salts there require mention:</p>

<p><i>Ammonium sulphate</i> ((NH₄)₂SO₄), which serves for the production
of other ammonium salts. It is usually centrifugalised
out from the sulphuric acid tank previously described.</p>

<p><i>Ammonium chloride</i> (sal-ammoniac, NH₄Cl) is formed by
bringing the ammonia fumes given off in the process described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in contact with hydrochloric acid vapour. The crude salt
so obtained is recrystallised or sublimed.</p>

<p><i>Ammonium phosphate</i> ((NH₄)₂HPO₄) is made in an analogous
manner by leading ammonia into phosphoric acid. It is
useful as an artificial manure.</p>

<p><i>Ammonium carbonate</i> is made either by bringing together
ammonia vapour and carbonic acid or by subliming ammonium
sulphate with calcium carbonate. It is very volatile. The
thick vapour is collected and purified in leaden chambers.</p>

ammonia; (b) Economiser; (f) Milk of lime; (g) Pump</p>

</div>

<p><i>Caustic ammonia</i> is prepared either from gas liquor or, more
usually, from ammonium sulphate by distillation with caustic
alkali in a continuous apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Use of Ammonia.</span>—Ammonia is used in laundries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
bleaching works in dyeing and wool washing. It is used
especially in making ammonium salts, in the preparation of
soda by the Solvay process (see Soda Manufacture), and in
making ice artificially.</p>

<p>It is used also in the preparation of indigo, in lacquers and
colours, and the extraction of chloride of silver, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Industrial ammonia poisoning is
rare. It occurs most frequently in gas works and occasionally
in its use, especially the manufacture of ammonium salts. Those
engaged in subliming ammonium carbonate incur special
risk, but often it is not the ammonia vapour so much as the
escaping evil-smelling gases containing carbon bisulphide and
cyanogen compounds which are the source of trouble.</p>

<p>Occasionally in the production of ice through leakage or
by the breaking of carboys of ammonia accidental poisoning
has occurred.</p>

<p>Some cases are cited from recent literature:</p>

<p>A worker was rendered unconscious and drowned in an
ammonia water well.<a href="#endnote86" id="endnote-ref86"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> Two workers were poisoned (one
fatally) in the concentration of gas liquor. Three workers were
gassed (one fatally) in the preparation of ammonium sulphate
in a gas works. Probably as the result of excessive steam
pressure gas water was driven over with the ammonia into
the sulphuric acid vessel.<a href="#endnote87" id="endnote-ref87"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> </p>

<p>Eulenberg<a href="#endnote88" id="endnote-ref88"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> reports the occurrence of sulphuretted hydrogen
gas poisoning in the production of ammonium salts. The
workers succumbed as though shot, although work was being
carried on in the open air. They recovered when removed
from the poisonous atmosphere.</p>

<p>In a large room of a chemical factory phosphoric acid was
being saturated with ammonia gas water in an iron lead-lined
vessel. Carbonic acid gas and hydrogen gas were
evolved, but not to such extent as to be noticeable in the large
room. A worker not employed in the room had to do something
close to the vessel, and inhaled some of the fumes given
off. A few yards from the vessel he was found lying unconscious,
and although removed into the open air failed to respond
to the efforts at artificial respiration.<a href="#endnote89" id="endnote-ref89"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> </p>

<p>Lewin, in an opinion delivered to the Imperial Insurance
Office, describes poisoning in a man who during two days had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
been employed repairing two ammonia retorts in a chemical
factory. On the evening of the second day he suffered from
severe symptoms of catarrh, from which he died five days
later. Lewin considered the case to be one of acute ammonia
poisoning.<a href="#endnote90" id="endnote-ref90"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> </p>

<p>Ammonia is frequently used in <i>fulling</i> cloth, the fumes
of which collect on the surface after addition of sulphuric acid
to the settling vats. This is especially liable to occur on a
Monday, owing to the standing of the factory over the Sunday,
so that entrance into the vats without suitable precautions
is strictly forbidden. Despite this, a worker did go in to fetch
out something that had fallen in, becoming immediately unconscious.
A rescuer succumbed also and lost his life. The first
worker recovered, but was for long incapacitated by paralytic
symptoms.</p>

<p>Cases of poisoning in <i>ice factories</i> and refrigerator rooms
from defective apparatus are reported.</p>

<p>Acute and chronic poisoning among sewer men are due
mainly to sulphuretted hydrogen gas and only partly to
ammonia. The more ammonia and the less sulphuretted
hydrogen sewer gases contain the less poisonous are they.</p>

<h4>CYANOGEN COMPOUNDS</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment of the Materials used in Gas purifying.</span>—Cyanogen
compounds are still sometimes prepared by the
original method of heating to redness nitrogenous animal
refuse (blood, leather, horn, hair, &amp;c.) with potash and iron
filings; potassium cyanide is formed from the nitrogen, carbon,
and alkali, and this with the sulphur and iron present is easily
converted into potassium ferrocyanide (yellow prussiate of
potash, K₄FeC₆N₆) by lixiviation of the molten mass. It
crystallises out on evaporation.</p>

<p>Cyanogen compounds are obtained in large quantity from
the material used in purifying the gas in gas works. This
saturated spent material contains, in addition to 30-40 per
cent. of sulphur, 8-15 per cent. of cyanogen compounds and
1-4 per cent. of sulphocyanogen compounds.</p>

<p>By lixiviation with water the soluble ammonium salts are
extracted from the purifying material. This solution furnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
<i>sulphocyanide of ammonium</i>, from which the remaining unimportant
sulphocyanide compounds are obtained (used in cloth
printing). The further treatment of the purifying material
for potassium ferrocyanide is rendered difficult because of
the sulphur, which is either removed by carbon bisulphide
and the ferrocyanide obtained by treatment with quicklime
and potassium chloride, or the mass is mixed with quicklime,
steamed in closed vessels, lixiviated with water, and decomposed
by potassium chloride; ferrocyanide of potassium and
calcium separates out in crystals, and this, treated with
potash, yields potassium ferrocyanide.</p>

<p>The well-known non-poisonous pigment Prussian blue is
obtained by decomposing ferrocyanide of potash with chloride
or oxide of iron in solution.</p>

<p><i>Potassium cyanide</i> (KCN) is prepared from potassium
ferrocyanide by heating in absence of air, but it is difficult to
separate it entirely from the mixture of iron and carbon which
remains. All the cyanogen is more easily obtained in the form
of potassium and sodium cyanide from potassium ferrocyanide
by melting it with potash and adding metallic sodium.</p>

<p>The very poisonous <i>hydrocyanic acid</i> (prussic acid, HCN)
is formed by the action of acids on potassium or sodium
cyanide; small quantities indeed come off on mere exposure
of these substances to the air. The increasing demand for
potassium cyanide has led to experimental processes for
producing it synthetically.</p>

<p>One method consists in the production of potassium
cyanide from potash and carbon in a current of ammonia gas.
Small pieces of charcoal are freed from air, saturated with a
solution of potash, dried in the absence of air, and heated in
upright iron cylinders to 100° C., while a stream of ammonia
gas is passed through.</p>

<p>Again, sodium cyanide is prepared from ammonia, sodium,
and carbon by introducing a definite amount of sodium and
coal dust into melted sodium cyanide and passing ammonia
through. The solution is then concentrated in vacuo and
sodium cyanide crystallises out on cooling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Use of Cyanides.</span>—Potassium cyanide is principally used
in the recovery of gold, in gold and silver electroplating, in
photography, for soldering (it reduces oxides and makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
metallic surfaces clean), for the production of other cyanogen
compounds, for the removal of silver nitrate stains, &amp;c. Hydrocyanic
acid gas is given off in electroplating, photography, in
smelting fumes, in tanning (removing hair by gas lime), &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Industrial cyanogen poisoning is
rare. Weyl<a href="#endnote91" id="endnote-ref91"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> states that he could find no case in any of the
German factory inspectors’ reports for the twenty years prior
to 1897, nor in some twenty-five volumes of foreign factory
inspectors’ reports. I have found practically the same in my
search through the modern literature.</p>

<p>Of the very few references to the subject I quote the most
important.</p>

<p>A case of (presumably) chronic hydrocyanic acid poisoning
is described in a worker engaged for thirteen years in silver
electroplating of copper plates.<a href="#endnote92" id="endnote-ref92"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> The plates were dipped in a
silver cyanide solution and then brushed. After two years
he began to show signs of vomiting, nausea, palpitation, and
fatigue, which progressed and led to his death.</p>

<p>A case of sudden death is described<a href="#endnote93" id="endnote-ref93"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> occurring to a worker
in a sodium cyanide factory who inhaled air mixed with hydrocyanic
acid gas from a leaky pipe situated in a cellar. The
factory made sodium cyanide and ammonium sulphate from
the residue after removal of the sugar from molasses. This is
the only definite case of acute cyanogen poisoning in a factory
known to me. I believe that under modern conditions, in
which the whole process is carried on under negative pressure,
chance of escape of cyanogen gases is practically excluded.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that hydrocyanic acid vapour is
given off in the burning of celluloid. In this way eight persons
were killed at a fire in a celluloid factory.<a href="#endnote94" id="endnote-ref94"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> </p>

<p>Skin affections are said to be caused by contact with fluids
containing cyanogen compounds, especially in electroplating.
It is stated that workers coming into contact with solutions
containing cyanides may absorb amounts sufficient to cause
symptoms, especially if the skin has abrasions. Such cases
are described.<a href="#endnote95" id="endnote-ref95"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> In electroplating, further, in consequence of
the strong soda solutions used, deep ulceration and fissures of
the skin of the hand can be caused.</p>

<h4>COAL TAR AND TAR PRODUCTS</h4>

<p>Of the products of the illuminating gas industry tar has
considerably the most importance. Coal tar as such has
varied use in industry, but far greater use is made of the products
obtained by fractional distillation from it such as benzene,
toluene, naphthalene, anthracene, carbolic acid, pyridine, and
the other constituents of tar, a number of which form the
starting-point in the production of the enormous coal-tar dye
industry. Especially increasing is the consumption of benzene.
In Germany alone this has increased in ten years from 20 to
70 million kilos. This is partly due to the need of finding
some cheap substitute for benzine, the consumption and cost
of which has increased, and it has in many respects been found
in benzene.</p>

<p>Besides benzene and its homologues, toluene, anthracene, and
naphthalene are valuable. Anthracene is used in the manufacture
of alizarine and naphthalene in that of artificial indigo
and of the azo-colours. Carbolic acid (phenol) and the homologous
cresols serve not only as disinfectants but also in
the manufacture of numerous colours and in the preparation
of picric acid and salicylic acid. Further, a number of pharmaceutical
preparations and saccharin are made from the
constituents of tar.</p>

<p>The important <i>constituents of tar</i> are:</p>

<p>1. Hydrocarbons of the methane series: paraffins, olefines;
hydrocarbons of the aromatic series: benzene and its homologues,
naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Phenols (cresols, naphthols).</p>

<p>3. Sulphides: sulphuretted hydrogen, carbon bisulphide,
mercaptan, thiophene.</p>

<p>4. Nitrogen compounds: ammonia, methylamine, aniline,
pyridine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. Fifty to sixty per cent. of tar consists of pitch constituting
a mixture of many different substances which
cannot be distilled without decomposition.</p>

<p><i>Crude tar</i>, i.e. tar which separates in the dry distillation of
coal, is employed as such for preserving all kinds of building
materials, for tarring streets, as plastic cement, as a disinfectant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in the preparation of roofing paper or felt, lampblack,
briquettes, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Brattice cloth</i> and <i>roofing felt</i> are made by passing the
materials through hot tar and incorporating sand with them;
in doing this heavy fumes are given off.</p>

<p><i>Lampblack</i> is made by the imperfect combustion of tar or
tar oil by letting them drop on to heated iron plates with as
limited an air supply as possible; the burnt gases laden with
carbon particles are drawn through several chambers or sacks
in which the soot collects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="fig23">

<img src="images/fig23.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>—Tar Still (<i>after Krämer</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Briquettes</i> (patent fuel) are made by mixing small coal (coal
dust) with tar or pitch and then pressing them in moulds.</p>

<p>The separation and recovery of the valuable ingredients is
effected by <i>fractional distillation</i>. This is carried out by heating
the tar at gradually increasing temperature in a wrought-iron
still, the bottom of which is arched and having a cast-iron
still head, or in horizontal boilers by direct fire. Before
commencing the distillation the tar is freed as far as possible
of water by storage. On gradual increase of temperature the
volatile constituents, the so-called ‘light oil,’ and later the
heavier volatile constituents come over. The constituents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
are liberated in a gaseous state and are collected in fractions.
The pitch remains behind in the still. Considerable quantities
of coal tar are not distilled for pitch. Often the light oils
and a portion of the heavy oils are collected, when soft pitch
remains, or, if the light oils and only a very small portion of
the heavy oils are collected, <i>asphalt</i> remains behind, this residue
being used as a basis for the manufacture of roofing felt.
The vapours are condensed in iron coils round which cold
water circulates. The receivers in which the distillate is caught
are changed at definite times as the temperature gradually
rises. If five fractions have come over they are called (1) first
runnings, (2) light oil to 170° C., (3) middle oil (carbolic oil to
230° C.), (4) heavy oil to 270° C., and lastly (5) anthracene
oil, which distills at over 270° C.; the pitch remaining behind
is let out of the still by an opening at the bottom.</p>

<p>We will briefly sketch the further treatment and use of
these fractions, so far as a knowledge of the most important
processes is necessary for our purpose.</p>

<p>1. The <i>light oils</i> (including first runnings) coming over
up to 170° C. are again distilled and then purified with
sulphuric acid in lead-lined cast-iron or lead-lined wooden
tanks. The dark-coloured acid used for purifying after
dilution with water, which precipitates tarry matters, is treated
for ammonium sulphate; the basic constituents of the light
oils extracted with sulphuric acid and again liberated by lime
yield <i>pyridine</i> (C₅H₅N) and the homologous pyridine bases, a
mixture of which is used for denaturing spirit. After the
light oils have been washed with dilute caustic soda liquor,
whereby the phenols are removed, they are separated by
another fractional distillation into (<i>a</i>) crude benzol (70°-130° C.)
and (<i>b</i>) solvent naphtha (boiling-point 130°-170° C.).</p>

<p><i>Crude benzol</i> (70°-140° C.) consists chiefly of benzene and
toluene and is separated into its several constituents in
special rectifying apparatus. For this production of pure
benzene (boiling-point 80°-82° C.) and pure toluene (boiling-point
110° C.) fractionating apparatus is used (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>commercial products</i> in use which are obtained from
the fractional distillation of the light oil are:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Ninety per cent. benzol</i>, so called because in the
distillation 90 per cent, should come over at a temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of 100° C. It is
made up of 80-85
per cent. benzene,
13-15 per cent.
toluene, 2-3 per
cent. xylene, and
contains, as impurities,
traces of
olefines, paraffins,
sulphuretted hydrogen,
and other
bodies.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Fifty per
cent. benzol</i> contains
50 per cent.
of constituents
distilling at 100°
C. and 90 per cent.
at 120° C.; it is
a very mixed product,
with only
40-50 per cent. of
benzene.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Solvent
naphtha</i>, so called
because it is largely
used for dissolving
rubber, is free
from benzene, but
contains xylene
and its homologues
and other
unknown hydrocarbons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;" id="fig24">

</div>

<p>Benzol is widely
used. Ninety
per cent. benzol
is largely used in
the chemical industry,
serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
for the preparation of dye stuffs, pharmaceutical preparations,
scents, &amp;c. In other industries it took the place of
benzine and also of turpentine oil, especially in the paint
industry, since it evaporates quickly and readily dissolves
resins. Hence it is used in the preparation of quick drying
ship’s paints, as a protection against rust, and as an isolating
lacquer (acid proof colours) for electrical apparatus, in the
production of deck varnishes, and as a solvent of resins.</p>

<p>This use of benzol in the paint industry is by no means
unattended with danger, as benzol is poisonous. Far less
harmful, if not altogether without risk, is use of benzol free
solvent naphtha—but this evaporates only slowly and hence
cannot take the place of benzol.</p>

<p>Benzol serves further for fat extraction from bones in
manure factories and of caffein from coffee beans.</p>

<p>Again, it is used as a motive power in motor vehicles.</p>

<p>The solvent naphtha above mentioned with boiling-point
above 140° C. and all the light oils are employed in chemical
cleaning and for dissolving indiarubber (see Indiarubber).</p>

<p>These are known in the trade erroneously as ‘benzine,’
which unfortunately often leads to confusion with petroleum
benzine (see Petroleum) and to mistakes in toxicological
accounts of poisoning.</p>

<p>2. Between 150° and 200° C. the <i>middle oil</i> comes over, from
which on cooling <i>naphthalene</i> (C₁₀H₈) crystallises out, and is
subsequently washed with caustic soda liquor and with acid;
it is re-distilled and hot pressed. The remaining liquor yields,
when extracted with caustic soda, <i>phenol</i> (carbolic acid, C₆H₅OH),
which, on addition of sulphuric acid or carbonic acid, separates
from the solution and then—generally in special factories—is
obtained pure by distillation and special purifying
processes.</p>

<p>From the sodium salt of carbolic acid (sodium phenolate)
<i>salicylic acid</i> (C₆H₄OH.COOH) is obtained by combination
with compressed CO₂ at a temperature of 150° C. <i>Picric acid</i>
(trinitrophenol, C₆H₂OH.(NO₂)₃) is obtained by treating phenol
with a mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids (nitration). The
yellow crystals of this explosive which separate are carefully
washed, recrystallised, centrifugalised, and dried.</p>

<p>3. The <i>heavy oils</i> which come over between 200° and 300° C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
containing cresols, naphthols, naphthaline, quinoline bases,
fluid paraffins, &amp;c., are seldom separated further. The disinfectants
lysol, sapocarbolic, &amp;c., are obtained from such
fractions.</p>

<p>The heavy oils are much in use for <i>impregnating wood</i>
(piles, railway sleepers, &amp;c.), to prevent rotting. This is
done in special creosoting installations. The wood is first
freed from moisture under vacuum and lastly the heavy oil
forced in. This is a better means of preserving timber than
the analogous method by means of chloride of zinc.</p>

<p>4. <i>Anthracene oil</i> or ‘green oil’ comes over between 300°
and 400° C. and contains the valuable anthracene which
crystallises out, is separated from the oil in filter presses, or
dried in centrifugal machines. <i>Alizarin</i> dyes are made from
it. Raw anthracene oil further is used commercially as a paint
under the name of carbolineum for preserving wood.</p>

<p>5. The <i>pitch</i> remaining behind in the still serves (like tar)
for making varnishes, patent fuel, &amp;c. For our purpose use of
pitch in the preparation of iron varnishes which adhere to
metals and protect them from oxidation have interest. Pitch
and the heavy oils are melted together or, if for thin varnishes,
dissolved in solvent naphtha. The volatile constituents
evaporate after the coat has been applied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—Severe injury to health or poisoning
cases scarcely arise through manipulations with or use of tar.
Inhalation, however, of large quantities of tar vapour is
without doubt unpleasant, as a number of poisonous substances
are contained in the fumes. And the ammonia water
which separates on standing can give off unpleasantly
smelling odours from the sulphur compounds in it, especially
if it comes into contact with waste acids, with consequent
development of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p>I could not find in the literature of the subject references
to any clearly proved case of poisoning from tar emanations.
But deserving of mention in this connection are the <i>effects
on the skin</i> caused by tar.</p>

<p>Workers coming into contact with tar suffer from an
inflammatory affection of the skin, so-called tar eczema, which
occasionally takes on a cancerous (epithelioma) nature similar
to chimney-sweep’s cancer, having its seat predominantly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the scrotum. In lampblack workers who tread down the
soot in receptacles the malady has been observed to affect the
lower extremities and especially the toes.</p>

<p>In tar distillation and in the <i>production</i> and <i>use</i> of <i>benzene</i>
industrial poisoning frequently occurs. Many cases are recorded,
but in several the immediate exciting cause is doubtful, and
consequently it is often difficult to classify the cases.</p>

<p>Most frequently the manufacture and use of benzene come
in question. Besides this, in tar distillation poisoning may be
caused by other substances, such as sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
carbonic oxide gas, &amp;c. In the production of antipyrin,
aspirin, &amp;c., and in the preparation and use of anthracene injury
to health is recognised.</p>

<p>From the list of recognised cases of these forms of poisoning
the most characteristic are chosen from the recent literature on
the subject.</p>

<p>The Prussian factory inspectors’ reports for 1904 describe
the following: In cleaning out a tar still two workers were
killed by inhalation of gas. The nature of the gas was not
ascertained. But what probably happened was that the cock
on the foul gas pipe collecting the gases from the stills leaked
and allowed fumes to pass over from one still to another.</p>

<p>A foreman and worker were rendered unconscious on
entering a receiver for heavy oil for cleaning purposes. On
treatment with oxygen gas they speedily recovered.</p>

<p><i>Industrial benzene poisoning</i> is especially frequent now in
view of the increasing use to which it is put. Several cases
have proved fatal.</p>

<p>A worker, for instance, forgot to open the cock for the water
to cool the condenser, so that some of the benzene vapour
remained uncondensed. The case proved fatal.</p>

<p>The Report of the Union of Chemical Industry for 1905
stated that a worker on night duty, whose duty it was to
regulate the introduction of steam and the cooling of the benzol
plant, was found lying dead in front of the building. Inquiry
showed that he had not opened the valve for running the
distillate into the appropriate receiver. Eight thousand
litres overflowed.</p>

<p>In an indiarubber extracting factory a worker was rendered
unconscious while inspecting a benzol still; before entering he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
had omitted to observe the instructions to drive steam through
and have a mate on watch at the manhole. Two other workmen
were similarly affected who went to the rescue without
adoption of precautions. Only one survived.</p>

<p>In a further accident (already mentioned under ‘Coke
Furnaces’) two workmen were killed. In the factory in question
the thick tar from the coke ovens was being distilled under
slight pressure. The air pumps, however, were out of order,
and temporary use was being made of Körting’s injectors,
whereby the steam and tar constituents were cooled and led
into the drain in front of the closet, near to which was a ventilating
shaft. Probably, in addition to benzene and its homologues,
sulphuretted hydrogen and cyanogen compounds were
present in the poisonous gases.</p>

<p>In cleaning out a benzene extracting apparatus a workman
was killed by the stagnant fumes in it.</p>

<p>A similar case of benzene poisoning occurred in a
naphthalamine works through inspecting an extracting vessel
which had contained benzene and naphthalamine and had
to be cleaned. The vessel had been empty for twenty-two
hours and had been washed and ventilated, but through a
leaking pipe benzene had dropped down into it. The workman
engaged was rendered unconscious inside the retort,
but was rescued by an engineer equipped with a breathing
helmet. Others who without such apparatus tried to effect a
rescue were overcome, and one who had entered the retort
succumbed.<a href="#endnote96" id="endnote-ref96"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> </p>

<p>Benzene poisoning has often occurred in the cleaning of
tanks, &amp;c., for the transport and storage of the substance.
The following examples are taken from the Reports of the
Union of Chemical Industry.</p>

<p>A worker during the pause for breakfast had, unknown to
his employer, cleaned out an empty truck for crude benzol.
Later he was with difficulty removed unconscious through the
manhole and could not be resuscitated. Only a short time
previously a similar occurrence had taken place in the same
factory.</p>

<p>Two further fatal cases were reported in 1908 in the cleaning
out of railway tank waggons. The tank had previously been
thoroughly sprayed with water. The partition plates which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
required in such tanks increase the difficulty of cleaning from
the manhole. After the foreman had tested the air by putting
his head inside and considered it free from danger, a man
entered to clean out the deposit; another man on watch
outside had evidently gone in for rescue purposes. Resuscitation
in both cases failed.</p>

<p>A worker died and several were affected in the cleaning out
of a benzol storage tank in a tar distillery. The tank had
had air blown through it several weeks before, and had been
thoroughly cleaned by steam and water. Also in the inspection
the greatest care was taken in only permitting work for
short spells. This shows that, notwithstanding great care,
the last traces of benzol cannot be entirely removed and that
quite small quantities are sufficient to cause severe and even
fatal poisoning. Workers should only clean out tanks,
therefore, when properly equipped with helmets.</p>

<p>In the German factory inspectors’ reports for 1902 a case
of intoxication is described in a man who was engaged painting
the inside of an iron reservoir with an asphalt paint dissolved in
benzol.</p>

<p>Of special interest is a fatal case from inhalation of benzol
fumes in a rubber factory. Rubber dissolved in benzol was
being rubbed into the cloth on a spreading machine in the
usual way. The cloth then passes under the cleaning doctor
along the long heated plate to the end rolls. Of the three men
employed at the process one was found to be unconscious and
could not be brought round again.</p>

<p>The cases described<a href="#endnote97" id="endnote-ref97"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> of poisoning with impure benzol in
a pneumatic tyre factory in Upsala are, perhaps, analogous.
Here nine young women had severe symptoms, four of whom
died.</p>

<p>In reference to the cases which occurred in rubber
factories it is conceivable that carbon bisulphide played a
part, since in such factories not only are mixtures of benzol
and carbon bisulphide used, but also frequently the ‘first
runnings’ of benzol, which, on account of the high proportion
(sometimes 50 per cent.) of carbon bisulphide in them, make an
excellent solvent for rubber.</p>

<p>From some coke ovens crude benzol was collected in two
large iron receivers. They were sunk in a pit projecting very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
little above the ground. To control the valves the workmen
had to mount on the receiver, the manholes of which were kept
open during filling. The pit was roofed over and two wooden
shafts served both for ventilation and as approaches to the
valves. One summer day benzol had been blown in the usual
way into a railway truck and a worker had entered the space
to control the valves. Some time afterwards he was found in a
doubled-up position on the receiver, grasping the valves, from
which later he fell off down to the bottom of the pit. Three
rescuers entered, but had to retire as they became affected. A
fourth worker, in the presence of the manager, was let down
by a rope, but succumbed immediately and was dragged up
a corpse. Finally, equipped with a smoke helmet, a rescuer
brought up the lifeless body of the first man. It was believed
that the benzol had distilled over warm and had evaporated
to such an extent as to fill with fumes the unsuitably arranged
and inadequately ventilated space. Possibly other volatile
compounds were responsible for the poisoning.<a href="#endnote98" id="endnote-ref98"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> </p>

<p>A similar though less serious accident occurred to a foreman
who forgot to set the cooling apparatus at work at the commencement
of distillation, and became unconscious from the
escaping fumes, as also did a rescuer. The latter was brought
round by oxygen inhalation, but the former, although alive
when recovered, succumbed despite efforts at artificial
respiration.</p>

<p>A fatal case occurred in an aniline factory where benzol
fumes had escaped owing to faulty arrangement of the valves.
The worker, although ordered at once to leave the room, was
found there ten minutes later dead.</p>

<p>Interesting are the following cases of accidents due to use
of paints containing benzol.</p>

<p>In painting a retort with an anti-corrosive paint called
‘Original Anti-corrosive,’ unconsciousness followed on completion
of the painting, but by prompt rescue and medical
assistance life was saved. The accident was attributed to
benzol fumes from the paint insufficiently diluted by the air
coming in at the open manhole. A similar case arose from use
of a rust-preventing paint—‘Preolith’—and only with difficulty
was the man using it pulled out from the inside of the steam
boiler. Although resuscitated by oxygen inhalation, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
incapacitated for eight days. Crude benzol was a constituent
of ‘Preolith.’ Obviously use of such paints in closely confined
spaces is very risky.</p>

<p>The frequency of such poisonings caused Schaefer,<a href="#endnote99" id="endnote-ref99"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> Inspector
of Factories in Hamburg, to go fully into the question. He
lays stress on the dangerous nature of paints containing a high
proportion of benzol, but considers use of unpurified constituents
with boiling-point between 130°-170° C., such as solvent naphtha,
as free from risk (cf. in Part II the experiments on benzene and
the commercial kinds of benzol). Schaefer mentions that in
1903 and 1904 cases of unconsciousness from painting the
inside of boilers were numerous. The proportion of benzol
in the paints was 20-30 per cent. In 1905 and 1906 the cases
were attributable rather to inhalation of hydrocarbons in
cleaning of apparatus. Use of ‘Dermatin’ affected two
painters. One case in 1906 happened to a man painting the
double bottom of a ship in Hamburg harbour with ‘Black
Varnish Oil’ through the manhole, in doing which he inhaled
much of the fumes. This paint consisted of coal-tar pitch in
light coal-tar oil, the latter constituent (distilling at 170° C.)
amounting to 31-33 per cent. Investigation showed further
that the bulk of the tar oil volatilised at ordinary temperatures
and so quickly dried. Sulphuretted hydrogen gas was given
off on slight warming. The person after using it for some
time felt poorly, and then became ill with severe inflammation
of the respiratory passages, which proved fatal after twenty-four
days.</p>

<p>Several similar cases occurred in 1908 and 1909. Painting
the inside of a boiler with ‘Auxulin’ caused unconsciousness
in four persons, of whom three were rescuers. A fatal case
was due to use of a patent colour containing 30-40 per cent.
benzol in an entirely closed-in space (chain-well), although
the worker was allowed out into fresh air at frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>A case of chronic industrial xylene poisoning is described
in a worker using it for impregnating indiarubber goods. The
symptoms were nervous, resembling neurasthenia.</p>

<p>Some of the cases of poisoning, especially when severe and
fatal, in the production of distillation constituents of coal tar
are doubtless attributable to <i>sulphuretted hydrogen gas</i>. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in England, in the years 1901-3, there were eleven fatal and
as many other severe cases reported from tar distilleries, of
which the majority were due to sulphuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p>One case of <i>carbonic oxide</i> poisoning in coal-tar distillation
is described.<a href="#endnote100" id="endnote-ref100"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> In cleaning out pitch from a still fourteen days
after the last distillation a workman succumbed to carbonic
oxide poisoning. This is at all events a rare eventuality,
since no other case is to be found in the literature of the subject,
but it is a proof that in the last stage of coal-tar distillation
carbonic oxide plays a part.</p>

<p>Mention must be made of the frequent occurrence of
severe skin affections in <i>anthracene workers</i>; they take the
form of an eruption on the hands, arms, feet, knees, &amp;c., and
sometimes develop into cancer.</p>

<p>Observations in a chemical factory since 1892 showed that
of thirty thus affected in the course of ten years twenty-two
came into contact with paraffin.</p>

<h5>Artificial Organic Dye Stuffs (Coal-tar Colours)</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Manufacture.</span>—The starting-points for the preparation of
artificial coal-tar dyes are mainly those aromatic compounds
(hydrocarbons) described in the preceding section. Besides
these, however, there are the derivatives of the fatty series such
as methyl alcohol (wood spirit), ethyl alcohol, phosgene, and,
latterly, formaldehyde.</p>

<p>The <i>hydrocarbons of the benzene series</i> from tar distillation
are delivered almost pure to the colour factory. Of these
benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, anthracene, and the
phenols, cresols, &amp;c., have to be considered.</p>

<p>Further treatment is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Nitration, i.e. introduction of a nitro-group by means of
nitric acid.</p>

<p>2. Reduction of the nitrated products to amines.</p>

<p>3. Sulphonation, i.e. conversion to sulphonic acids by
means of concentrated sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>4. The sulphonic acids are converted into phenols by
fusing with caustic soda.</p>

<p>5. Introduction of chlorine and bromine.</p>

<p><i>Nitro-derivatives</i> are technically obtained by the action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
a mixture of nitric and concentrated sulphuric acids on the
aromatic body in question. The most important example is
<i>nitrobenzene</i>.</p>

<p>Benzene is treated for several hours in cylindrical cast-iron
pans with nitric and concentrated sulphuric acids. The vessel
is cooled externally and well agitated. A temperature of
25° C. should not be exceeded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="fig25">

(Closed Apparatus), showing Arrangement for Condensation (<i>after Leymann</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>On standing the fluid separates into two layers: the lower
consists of dilute sulphuric acid in which there is still some
nitric acid, and the upper of nitrobenzene. The latter is freed
of remains of acid by washing and of water by distillation.
<i>Toluene</i> and <i>xylene</i> are nitrated in the same way. <i>Dinitro
products</i> (such as metadinitrobenzene) are obtained by further
action of the nitro-sulphuric acid mixture on the mononitro-compound
at higher temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>For conversion of phenol into <i>picric acid</i> (trinitrophenol)
the use of a nitro-sulphuric acid mixture is necessary.</p>

<p>The <i>aromatic bases</i> (aniline, toluidine, xylidine) are obtained
by reduction of the corresponding nitro-compound by means
of iron filings and acid (hydrochloric, sulphuric, or acetic).
Thus in the case of <i>aniline</i> pure nitrobenzene is decomposed
in an iron cylindrical apparatus, provided with agitators and
a condenser, and avoidance of a too violent reaction, by means
of fine iron filings and about 5 per cent. hydrochloric acid.
After completion of the reaction the contents are rendered
alkaline by addition of lime and the aniline distilled over.
Manufacture of <i>toluidine</i> and <i>xylidine</i> is analogous.</p>

<p><i>Dimethylaniline</i> is obtained by heating aniline, aniline
hydrochloride, and methyl alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Diethylaniline</i> is prepared in an analogous way with the
use of ethyl alcohol.</p>

<p>By the action of nitrous acid (sodium nitrite and hydrochloric
acid) on the acid solution of the last-named compound
the <i>nitroso compounds</i> are formed.</p>

<p><i>Sulphonic acids</i> arise by the action of concentrated or fuming
sulphuric acid on the corresponding bodies of the aromatic
series: benzene disulphonic acid from benzene and fuming
sulphuric acid, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Phenols</i> and <i>cresols</i> are obtained pure from tar distillation.
The remaining hydroxyl derivatives (resorcin, α- and β-naphthol,
&amp;c.), are generally obtained by the action of concentrated
caustic soda on aromatic sulphonic acids.</p>

<p>The most important aromatic aldehyde, <i>benzaldehyde</i>,
is obtained from toluene; on introducing chlorine at boiling
temperature benzyl chloride is first formed, then benzal-chloride
and finally benzo-trichloride. In heating benzal-chloride
with milk of lime (under pressure) benzaldehyde is
formed (C₆H₅COH).</p>

<p><i>Picric acid</i> and <i>naphthol yellow</i> belong to the <i>nitro dyestuffs</i>;
the last named is obtained by sulphonating α-naphthol with
fuming sulphuric acid and by the action of nitric acid on
the sulphonated mixture.</p>

<p>Nitroso derivatives of aromatic phenols yield (with metal
oxides) the material for production of nitroso dyestuffs. To
these belong naphthol green, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The most important <i>azo dyestuffs</i> technically are produced
in principle by the action of nitrous acid on the aromatic
amines. The amido compound is converted into the diazo
salt by treatment with sodium nitrite in acid solution. Thus
diazo-benzene is made from aniline. Diazo compounds are
not usually isolated but immediately coupled with other
suitable compounds—amido derivatives, phenols—i.e. converted
into azo compounds.</p>

<p>The combination of the two constituents takes place at
once and quantitatively. The colour is separated from the
aqueous solution by salting-out, and is then put through a
filter press. The reactions are carried out generally in wooden
vats arranged in stages. Besides a second, a third constituent
can be introduced, and in this way naphthol—and naphthylamine
sulphonic acids yield a large number of colouring matters.
A very large number of azo dyestuffs can thus be produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
by the variation of the first component (the primary base)
with the second and again with the third component, but it
would carry us too far to deal further with their preparation.</p>

<p><i>Anthracene colours</i>—yielding so-called direct dyes—are prepared
from anthracene, which is converted into anthraquinone
by the action of bichromate and dilute sulphuric acid when
heated; the crude ‘quinone’ is purified with concentrated
sulphuric acid and converted into anthraquinone monosulphonic
acid to serve in the preparation of <i>alizarin</i>, which is made from
it by heating for several days with concentrated caustic soda
to which sodium chlorate is added. The process is carried on
in cast-iron pans provided with agitators.</p>

<p><i>Alizarin</i> is the starting-point for the alizarin dyes, but of
their production we will not speak further, as they, and indeed
most of the coal-tar dyes, are non-poisonous.</p>

<p><i>Indigo</i> to-day is generally obtained by synthesis. It
is prepared from phenylglycine or phenylglycine ortho-carboxylic
acid, which on heating with sodamide becomes
converted into indoxyl or indoxyl carboxylic acid. These in
presence of an alkali in watery solution and exposure to the
oxygen of the air immediately form indigo. The necessary
glycine derivatives are obtained by the action of monochloracetic
acid on aniline or anthranilic acid, which again are derived
from naphthalene (by oxidation to phthalic acid and treatment
of phthalimide with bleaching powder and soda
liquor).</p>

<p><i>Fuchsin</i> belongs to the group of triphenylmethane dyestuffs,
with the production of which the epoch of coal-tar colour
manufacture began, from the observation that impure aniline
on oxidation gave a red colour. The original method of
manufacture with arsenic acid is practically given up in
consequence of the unpleasant effects which use and recovery
of large quantities of arsenic acid gave rise to. The method
consisted in heating a mixture of aniline and toluidine with
a solution of arsenic acid under agitation in cast-iron cylinders.
The cooled and solidified mass from the retorts was boiled,
and from the hot solution, after filtration, the raw fuchsin was
precipitated with salt and purified by crystallisation.</p>

<p>Now by the usual nitrobenzene process, aniline, toluidine,
nitrobenzene, and nitrotoluene are heated with admixture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
hydrochloric acid and some iron protochloride or zinc chloride.
Further treatment resembles the arsenic process.</p>

<p>By alkylation, i.e. substitution of several hydrogen atoms of
the amido-groups by ethyl, &amp;c., through the action of alkyl
halogens and others, it was found possible to convert fuchsin
into other triphenylmethane colours. But it was soon found
simpler to transfer already alkylated amines into the colours in
question. Thus, for example, to prepare <i>methyl violet</i> dimethyl
aniline was heated for a long time with salt, copper chloride,
and phenol containing cresol in iron mixing drums. The
product is freed from salt and phenol by water and calcium
hydrate, subsequently treated with sulphuretted hydrogen
or sodium sulphide, and the colour separated from copper
sulphide by dissolving in dilute acid.</p>

<p>Mention must be made, finally, of the <i>sulphur dyes</i> obtained
by heating organic compounds with sulphur or sodium
sulphide. For the purpose derivatives of diphenylamine, nitro- and
amido-phenols, &amp;c., serve as the starting-point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects on Health.</span>—From what has been said of the
manufacture of coal-tar dyes it is evident that poisoning
can arise from the initial substances used (benzene, toluene,
&amp;c.), from the elements or compounds employed in carrying
out the reactions (such as chlorine, nitric acid, sulphuric acid,
arsenious acid, sodium sulphide, and sulphuretted hydrogen
gas), from the intermediate bodies formed (nitro and amido
compounds, such as nitrobenzene, dinitrobenzene, aniline,
&amp;c.), and that, finally, the end products (the dyes themselves)
can act as poisons. It has already been said that most of
the dyes are quite harmless unless contaminated with the
poisonous substances used in their manufacture.</p>

<p>We have seen that many of the raw substances used in the
manufacture of coal-tar dyes are poisonous, and we shall learn
that several of the intermediate products (especially the nitro
and amido compounds) are so also.</p>

<p>According to Grandhomme,<a href="#endnote101" id="endnote-ref101"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> of the raw materials benzene
is the one responsible for most poisoning. He describes two
fatal cases of benzene poisoning. In one case the worker was
employed for a short time in a room charged with benzene
fumes, dashed suddenly out of it, and died shortly after. In
the other, the workman was employed cleaning out a vessel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
which lixiviation with benzene had taken place. Although
the vessel had been steamed and properly cooled, so much
benzene fume came off in emptying the residue as to overcome
the workman and cause death in a short time.</p>

<p>Grandhomme describes no injurious effect from naphthalene
nor, indeed, from anthracene, which he considered was without
effect on the workers.</p>

<p>Similarly, his report as to nitrobenzene was favourable.
No reported case of poisoning occurred among twenty-one men
employed, in some of whom duration of employment was from
ten to twenty years. Aniline poisoning, however, was frequent
among them. In the three years there was a total of forty-two
cases of anilism, involving 193 sick days—an average
of fourteen cases a year and sixty-four sick days. None
was fatal and some were quite transient attacks.</p>

<p>In the fuchsin department no cases occurred, and any evil
effects in the manufacture were attributable to arsenic in the
now obsolete arsenic process. Nor was poisoning observed in
the preparation of the dyes in the remaining departments—blues,
dahlias, greens, resorcin, or eosin. In the manufacture
of methylene blue Grandhomme points out the possibility of
evolution of arseniuretted hydrogen gas from use of hydrochloric
acid and zinc containing arsenic. Poisoning was
absent also in the departments where alizarine colours and
pharmaceutical preparations were made.</p>

<p>Among the 2500-2700 workers Grandhomme records
122 cases of industrial sickness in the three years 1893-5,
involving 724 sick days. In addition to forty-two cases of
anilism there were seventy-six cases of lead poisoning with 533
sick days. Most of these were not lead burners, but workers
newly employed in the nitrating department who neglected
the prescribed precautionary measures. Lastly, he mentions
the occurrence of chrome ulceration.</p>

<p>The frequency of sickness in the Höchst factory in each of
the years 1893-5 was remarkably high: 126 per cent., 91 per
cent., and 95 per cent. Much less was the morbidity in the
years 1899-1906—about 66 per cent.—recorded by Leymann<a href="#endnote102" id="endnote-ref102"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> —probably
the same Höchst factory with 2000 to 2200
employed. And the cases of industrial poisoning also
were less. He cites only twenty-one in the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
period 1899-1906. Of these twelve were due to aniline,
involving thirty sick days, only five to lead poisoning, with
fifty-four sick days, one to chrome ulceration, one to
arseniuretted hydrogen gas (nine sick days), and one
fatal case each from sulphuretted hydrogen gas and from
dimethyl sulphate. In 1899, of three slight cases of aniline
poisoning one was attributable to paranitraniline (inhalation
of dust), and the two others to spurting of aniline oil on
to the clothing, which was not at once changed. Of the
four cases in 1900, one was a plumber repairing pipes
conveying aniline and the others persons whose clothes had
been splashed.</p>

<p>In 1903 a worker employed for eleven and a half years in
the aniline department died of cancer of the bladder. Such
cancerous tumours have for some years been not infrequently
observed in aniline workers, and operations for their removal
performed. Leymann thinks it very probable that the
affection is set up, or its origin favoured, by aniline. This
view must be accepted, and the disease regarded as of industrial
origin. Three slight cases in 1904 and 1905 were due partly to
contamination of clothing and partly to inhalation of fumes.
Of the five cases of lead poisoning three were referable to
previous lead employment. Perforation of the septum of the
nose by bichromate dust was reported once only. A fatal
case from sulphuretted hydrogen gas and a case of poisoning
by arseniuretted hydrogen gas occurred in 1906, but their
origin could not be traced.</p>

<p>In large modern aniline dye factories, therefore, the health
of the workers is, on the whole, good and industrial poisoning
rare. Comparison of the two sets of statistics show that
improvement in health has followed on improved methods of
manufacture. Such cases of aniline poisoning as are reported
are usually slight, and often accounted for by carelessness on
the part of the workers.</p>

<p>Data as to the health of workers in factories manufacturing
or using nitro compounds are given in the English factory
inspectors’ reports for 1905. Even with fortnightly medical
examination in them, more than half the workers showed
signs of anæmia and slight cyanosis. Two men in a factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
employing twelve men in the manufacture of nitro compounds
were treated in hospital for cyanosis, distress of breathing,
and general weakness. One had only worked in the factory
for nine days. In another badly ventilated factory, of
twenty persons examined fourteen showed bluish-grey coloration
of the lips and face, ten were distinctly anæmic, and six
showed tremor and weakness of grasp.</p>

<p>Nitrobenzene poisoning arises from the fumes present in
aniline and roburite factories. Acute and chronic poisoning
by nitro compounds of the benzene series are described,
brought about by accident (fracture of transport vessels)
and by carelessness (splashing on to clothes). Cases of
optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve) as a result
of chronic nitrobenzene poisoning are described.</p>

<p>Dinitrobenzene and other nitro and dinitro compounds
are present in safety explosives. Thus roburite and bellite
consist of metadinitrobenzene and ammonium nitrate;
ammonite of nitronaphthalene and ammonium nitrate;
securite of the materials in roburite with ammonium oxalate
in addition. In roburite there may be also chlorinated nitro
compounds.</p>

<p>Leymann,<a href="#endnote103" id="endnote-ref103"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> describing accidents in the preparation of nitrophenol
and nitrochloro compounds, mentions four fatal cases
occurring in the manufacture of black dyes from mono- and
di-nitrophenols as well as mono- and di-nitrochlorobenzene and
toluene. In three of the cases dinitrophenol was the compound
at fault owing to insufficient care in the preparation,—the
result of ignorance until then of risk of poisoning from
mono- and tri-nitrophenol. One of the men had had to empty a
washing trough containing moist dinitrophenol. He suddenly
became collapsed, with pain in the chest, vomiting, fever, and
convulsions, and died within five hours. Another suffered from
great difficulty of breathing, fever, rapid pulse, dilatation of
the pupils, and died within a few hours in convulsions. Two
further cases of nitrochlorobenzene poisoning are referred to,
one of which was fatal. Four chlorobenzene workers after a
bout of drinking were found unconscious in the street, and
only recovered after eight to ten hours in hospital. The
symptoms were grey-blue colour of the skin, pallor of mucous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
membranes, lips, nose, and conjunctivæ, and peculiar chocolate-coloured
blood.</p>

<p>Many cases of poisoning from roburite are recorded.<a href="#endnote104" id="endnote-ref104"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> In
the Witten roburite factory it is stated that during the years
1890-7 almost all the workers had been ill.<a href="#endnote105" id="endnote-ref105"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> Only three
looked healthy—all the others suffered from more or less
pallor, blue lips, and yellowish conjunctivæ.</p>

<p>A case of chlorobenzene poisoning was reported with
symptoms of headache, cyanosis, fainting attacks, difficulty
of breathing, &amp;c., in a man who had worked only three weeks
with the substance.<a href="#endnote106" id="endnote-ref106"><span class="endnote-marker">6</span></a> </p>

<p>In the nitrotoluene department of an explosives factory
a number of the workmen suffered from symptoms of distress
in breathing, headache, &amp;c., of whom two, employed only a
short time, died. The poisoning was attributed, partly to
nitrotoluene and partly to nitrous fumes. As a contributing
cause it was alleged that in view of shortage of hands unsuitable
persons were engaged who neglected precautions.<a href="#endnote107" id="endnote-ref107"><span class="endnote-marker">7</span></a> </p>

<p>Nitronaphthalene is said to cause inflammation and
opacity of the cornea,<a href="#endnote108" id="endnote-ref108"><span class="endnote-marker">8</span></a> attributable either to long-continued
exposure (four to eight months) to nitronaphthalene vapour
or to spurting of the liquid into the eye.</p>

<p>I could not find reference in literature to actual cases of
poisoning by picric acid. They are referred to in a general
way only as causing skin affections.</p>

<p>Aniline poisoning arises generally from inhalation, but
absorption through the skin and less frequently inhalation of
dust of aniline compounds cause it. We have already laid
stress on the frequently severe cases resulting from carelessness
in spilling on to or splashing of, clothes without at once
changing them, breaking of vessels containing it, and entering
vessels filled with the vapour. In literature of old date many
such cases have been described, and it was stated that
workers were especially affected on hot days, when almost
all showed cyanosis. Such observations do not state fairly
the conditions to-day in view of the improvements which
Grandhomme and Leymann’s observations show have taken
place in aniline factories. Still, cases are fairly frequent.
Thus in a factory with 251 persons employed, thirty-three
cases involving 500 days of sickness were reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The Report of the Union of Chemical Industry for 1907
cites the case of a worker who was tightening up the leaky
wooden bung of a vessel containing aniline at a temperature of
200° C. He was splashed on the face and arms, and although
the burns were not in themselves severe he died the next day
from aniline absorption.</p>

<p>Cases of anilism are not infrequent among dyers. The
reports of the Swiss factory inspectors for 1905 describe a
case where a workman worked for five hours in clothes on to
which aniline had spurted when opening an iron drum. Similar
cases are described in the report of the English factory
inspectors for the same year. Aniline black dyeing frequently
gives rise to poisoning, and to this Dearden<a href="#endnote109" id="endnote-ref109"><span class="endnote-marker">9</span></a> of Manchester
especially has called attention.</p>

<p>Typical aniline poisoning occurred in Bohemia in 1908
in a cloth presser working with black dyes. While crushing
aniline hydrochloride with one hand, he ate his food with the
other. That the health of persons employed in aniline black
dyeing must be affected by their work is shown by medical
examination. For instance, the English medical inspector of
factories in the summer months of 1905 found among sixty
persons employed in mixing, preparing, and ageing 47 per cent.
with greyish coloration of lips and 57 per cent. characteristically
anæmic. Further, of eighty-two persons employed in padding,
washing, and drying, 34 per cent. had grey lips, 20 per cent.
were anæmic, and 14 per cent. with signs of acute or old effects
of chrome ulceration. Gastric symptoms were not infrequently
complained of. The symptoms were worse in hot
weather.</p>

<p>Use of aniline in other industries may lead to poisoning.
Thus in the extraction of foreign resins with aniline seventeen
workers suffered (eleven severely). Interesting cases of
poisoning in a laundry from use of a writing ink containing
aniline have been recorded.<a href="#endnote110" id="endnote-ref110"><span class="endnote-marker">10</span></a> </p>

<p>Reference is necessary to tumours of the bladder observed
in aniline workers. The first observations on the subject were
made by Rehn of Frankfurt, who operated in three cases.
Bachfeld of Offenbach noticed in sixty-three cases of aniline
poisoning bladder affections in sixteen. Seyberth described
five cases of tumours of the bladder in workers with long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
duration of employment in aniline factories.<a href="#endnote111" id="endnote-ref111"><span class="endnote-marker">11</span></a> In the Höchst
factory (and credit is due to the management for the step)
every suspicious case is examined with the cystoscope. In
1904 this firm collected information from eighteen aniline
factories which brought to light thirty-eight cases, of which
eighteen ended fatally. Seventeen were operated on, and of
these eleven were still alive although in three there had been
recurrence.</p>

<p>Tumours were found mostly in persons employed with
aniline, naphthylamine, and their homologues, but seven
were in men employed with benzidine.</p>

<p>Cases of benzene and toluidine poisoning in persons
superintending tanks and stills have been described.</p>

<p>Industrial paranitraniline poisoning has been described, and
a fatal case in the Höchst dye works was attributed by Lewin
(as medical referee) to inhalation of dust. Before his death
the workman had been engaged for five hours in hydro-extracting
paranitraniline.</p>

<p>Paraphenylene diamine leads not unfrequently to industrial
poisoning from use of ursol as a dye. It produces skin eruptions
and inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
respiratory passages.<a href="#endnote112" id="endnote-ref112"><span class="endnote-marker">12</span></a> No doubt the intermediate body
produced (diimine) acts as a powerful poison.</p>

<p>A case of metaphenylene diamine poisoning is quoted
in the Report of the Union of Chemical Industry for 1906.
A worker had brought his coffee and bread, contrary to the
rules, into the workroom and hidden them under a vessel containing
the substance. Immediately after drinking his coffee
he was seized with poisoning symptoms, and died a few days
later. Some of the poison must have dropped into his coffee.</p>

<p>Few instances of poisoning from pure aniline colours are
recorded.</p>

<p>At first all tar colours were looked upon as poisonous, but
as they were mostly triphenylmethane colours they would
contain arsenious acid. When the arsenic process was given
up people fell into the other extreme of regarding not only
the triphenylmethane colours but all others as non-poisonous,
until experience showed that production and use of some of
the tar colours might affect the skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, mention must be made of inflammation of the
cornea caused by methyl violet dust. The basic aniline
dyes are said to damage the eye. As opposed to this view is
the fact that methyl violet and auramine are used as anti-bactericidal
agents, for treatment of malignant tumours, and
especially in ophthalmic practice.</p>

<h4>LEAD (ZINC, SILVER)</h4>

<h5>OCCURRENCE OF INDUSTRIAL LEAD POISONING IN GENERAL</h5>

<p><i>Chronic lead poisoning</i> plays the most important rôle in
industrial metallic poisoning, and indeed in industrial poisoning
generally. The result everywhere where inquiry into industrial
poisoning has been instituted has been to place the number
of cases of lead poisoning at the top of the list; for one case
of other forms of industrial poisoning there are twenty of
lead.</p>

<p>In the last few years a very extensive literature and one
not easily to be surveyed has grown up on the subject of
chronic industrial lead poisoning. I cannot attempt as I have
done with other forms of poisoning to do justice to all sources
of literature on this subject.</p>

<p>As there is no obligation to notify industrial lead
poisoning<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>—or indeed any form of industrial poisoning—in
many countries, the most important source of information
is wanting. Nevertheless more or less comprehensive
inquiries as to the extent of the disease in general have been
made in different countries and large cities which furnish
valuable data.</p>

<p>An idea of the yearly number of cases of lead poisoning
occurring in Prussia is given in the following statistics of cases
treated in Prussian hospitals for the years 1895-1901:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>About half the cases, therefore, are caused by use of white
lead. The report of the sick insurance societies of the Berlin
painters gives information as to the proportion treated in
hospital to those treated at home, which was as 1:4.</p>

<p>The industries may be classified according to risk as
follows<a href="#endnote113" id="endnote-ref113"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> :</p>

<p>White lead workers, 33 per cent.; red lead workers, 32 per
cent.; shot and lead pipe workers, 20 per cent.; painters,
7-10 per cent.; lead and zinc smelters, 8-9 per cent.; printers,
0·5 per cent.</p>

<p>In Austria through the Labour Statistical Bureau comprehensive
information is being collected as to the occurrence of
lead poisoning in the most dangerous trades, but is not yet
published. The reports of the factory inspectors give a very
incomplete picture; for example, in 1905 only fifteen cases are
referred to. In the most recent report (1909) information of
lead poisoning is only given for thirty works. Teleky has
made a general survey of the occurrence of lead poisoning
from the reports of the Austrian sick insurance societies.<a href="#endnote114" id="endnote-ref114"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a>
From this we gather that in Vienna, with an average
membership of 200,000, there were, in the five year period
1902-6, 634, 656, 765, 718, 772 cases of illness involving
incapacity from mineral poisons, which Teleky assumes were
practically all cases of lead poisoning. By circularising
Austrian sick insurance societies outside Vienna with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
membership of about 400,000, Teleky obtained information
of 189 cases, which he considers too few.</p>

<p>In 1906-1908 inquiry was made by the sick insurance
societies in Bohemia as to the extent of lead poisoning. With
an average number employed of from 700,000 to 850,000 information
was obtained of 91, 147, and 132 cases in the three years
in question. The increase in 1907 was probably accounted for
by the greater attention paid to the subject.<a href="#endnote115" id="endnote-ref115"><span class="endnote-marker">3</span></a> The number of
ascertained cases of lead poisoning treated by the societies
of Hungary was 225 in 1901 and 161 in 1902. Teleky again
considers these figures too low, which is proved by Toth’s
publications as to lead poisoning in Hungarian lead smelting
works, and especially Chyzer’s on lead poisoning among
Hungarian potters. Legge has reported fully in the second
International Congress for Industrial Diseases in Brussels
(September 1910) on occurrence of industrial lead poisoning in
Great Britain in the years 1900 to 1909. During that period
6762 cases with 245 deaths occurred. The number of cases in
the course of the ten years had diminished by 50 per cent.
These figures appear remarkably small, but it has to be borne
in mind that the statistics referred to related only to cases
occurring in factories and workshops, and do not include cases
among house painters and plumbers. The number of such
cases which came to the knowledge of the Factory Department
in 1909 was 241 (with 47 deaths) and 239 in 1908 (with
44 deaths).</p>

<h5>LEAD, SILVER, AND ZINC SMELTING</h5>

<p><i>Lead</i> is obtained almost entirely from galena by three
different processes. In the <i>roast and reaction process</i> galena
is first roasted at 500°-600° C. and partially converted into
lead oxide and lead sulphate: on shutting off the air supply
and increase of temperature the sulphur of the undecomposed
galena unites with the oxygen of the lead oxide and sulphate to
form sulphur dioxide, while the reduced metallic lead is tapped.
In the <i>roast and reduction</i> process the ore is completely calcined
so as to get rid of sulphur, arsenic, and antimony. The oxides
(and sulphates) formed are reduced by means of coke in a blast
furnace. This process is generally applicable and is, therefore,
that most in use. The <i>precipitation</i> process consists chiefly in
melting galena with coke and iron flux, whereby the lead is
partly freed from the sulphur, and, in addition to lead, iron
sulphide is formed, which acts on the remaining lead sulphide,
producing a lead matte which can be further treated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The roast and reaction process is carried out in specially
constructed reverberatory furnaces; small furnaces with small
amounts of ore and at as low a temperature as possible are the
rule in the Kärntner process. In the English process large
amounts of ore are melted in large furnaces at high temperatures
so as to oxidise the material. The so-called Tarnowitz process
combines these two—large amounts of ore are roasted in
large furnaces at a moderate temperature. In the roast and
reduction process it depends on the nature of the ore whether
the roasting is done in reverberatory or blast furnaces.
Generally the ore is in the form of powder—less often in pieces.
Pyritic ore (ore with much sulphur) is almost always roasted in
blast furnaces, and the sulphur dioxide evolved can be used in
the manufacture of sulphuric acid. Open-hearth furnaces are
rarely used now. Reverberatory furnaces are employed most
frequently.</p>

<p>The lead thus obtained contains several other metals,
especially silver, copper, arsenic, antimony, iron, zinc, bismuth,
and tin. Lead containing silver (work-lead) is next <i>de-silverised</i>,
after which follows refining to get rid of the other impurities.
For de-silverising work-lead rich in silver (containing about
10 per cent.) <i>cupellation</i> is practised, in which the silver lead is
melted and oxidised so that the lead is converted into <i>litharge</i>,
metallic silver remaining behind. In a cupellation furnace
the flame strikes on the top of the lead bath, and at the same
time air under slight pressure is driven in; the litharge which
forms is removed through suitable openings. The litharge
that is first formed contains silver and is treated again; the
remainder is ready for market. After the litharge has run
off silver appears, containing still 5-10 per cent. of lead,
and it is again submitted to an analogous refining process.
Work-lead which does not contain enough silver to be
cupelled at once is generally treated first by either the
Pattinson or the Parkes’ process.</p>

<p>In the <i>Pattinson</i> crystallising process work-lead is melted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
open semi-circular pots: as the pots cool crystals of lead poor
in silver form on the surface and are transferred by a perforated
ladle into the next pot: the silver collects in the small amount
of molten lead remaining behind. Lead that has become
enriched by repeated crystallisation contains a high percentage
of silver and is cupelled. The <i>Parkes’</i> process or <i>zinc
de-silverisation</i> depends on the formation of a lead-zinc alloy
which is less fusible than lead. Work-lead is melted and
agitated with addition of pure zinc. The crust which first
rises on cooling contains gold, copper, zinc, and lead, and
is removed. Further addition of zinc is then made: the
rich silver crust which separates is subsequently freed from
lead by gradual heating in a reverberatory furnace, and from
zinc, in a zinc distilling retort. Other impurities are got rid
of by oxidising in reverberatory or other furnaces. Small
quantities of antimony and arsenic are removed by stirring with
fresh green sticks.</p>

<p><i>Zinc</i> is obtained principally from blende (sulphide of zinc)
and from calamine (carbonate of zinc). The process of zinc
recovery depends on the production of zinc oxide and reduction
of this by carbon to metallic zinc.</p>

<p>Conversion of the ore to zinc oxide is effected by roasting.
Since the temperature at which reduction takes place is higher
than the melting-point of zinc the latter is volatilised (distilled)
and must be condensed in suitable condensers.</p>

<p>Calamine is calcined in a blast furnace. Blende was
formerly roasted in reverberatory furnaces, but such nuisance
arose to the neighbourhood from sulphur dioxide vapour
that now Hasenclever-Helbig calcining furnaces are used.
These furnaces furnish a gas so rich in sulphur dioxide that
they serve at once for the production of sulphuric acid. The
Hasenclever furnaces consist of muffles placed one above
another: the finely ground ore is charged through hoppers
above and then raked down from muffle to muffle.</p>

<p>Reduction is carried out in the Belgian or Silesian process
by strongly heating calcined matte with coal in retorts. The
zinc as it distils is caught in special condensing receptacles
(prolongs). After distillation is complete the residue is raked
out of the muffle and the furnace charged afresh. As zinc ores
generally contain much lead, the work-zinc is therefore refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
by remelting in a reverberatory furnace, during which process
the impurities collect on the zinc as dross and are removed by
agitation with sal-ammoniac or magnesium chloride.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Risk of Poisoning in Lead, Silver, and Zinc Smelting.</span>—As
the description of the manipulations in smelting
processes shows, all involve risk of lead poisoning. As a matter
of fact in lead smelting much lead passes into the atmosphere.
In the smelting works at Tarnowitz yearly some 36,000 kilos
of oxidised lead escape.</p>

<p>Estimations<a href="#endnote116" id="endnote-ref116"><span class="endnote-marker">4</span></a> of the amount of lead in air samples collected
in lead smelting works have been made. Thus in a cubic
metre of air immediately over the slag run from 0·0029 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
0·0056 g. of lead were found, so that a worker in a ten-hour
day would inhale from 0·013 to 0·025 g. of lead. In a
cubic metre of air immediately above the Parkes’ melting-pot
from 0·0056 to 0·0090 g. were found, so that a worker would
inhale daily from 0·0252 to 0·0405 g. if he kept constantly
close to the pot. On the handles of a de-silveriser 0·112 g.
were found. In Hungarian lead-smelting works the water in
which the hands had been washed was found to contain
1·27 g. of lead per litre. The hands of litharge grinders
and sifters showed the highest amounts.</p>

<p>Work carried on in lead-smelting works may be divided
into five classes according to risk. Those most exposed to risk
are the smelters at lead hearths and reverberatory furnaces,
persons employed at the lead and slag runs, flue cleaners, and
in crushing and packing flake litharge. Next come those
employed at the refining furnaces, those breaking up the
roasted ore, blast furnace workers, and those employed at the
cupellation process. Attended with danger also is the removal
of lead ashes and distillation of the zinc crust. Less dangerous
are transport of material, crushing and mixing the ore, refining
the work-lead and zinc crust, and work at the Pattinson
and Parkes’ processes.</p>

<p>In zinc smelting risk of lead poisoning is great, no matter
which process is in question, because of the high proportion of
lead in the ore and work-zinc. Swedish blende contains as
much as 9 per cent. of lead, and Upper Silesian 2½ per cent. or
less. There is risk in calcination, but it is much less than in
the distillation process.<a href="#endnote117" id="endnote-ref117"><span class="endnote-marker">5</span></a> </p>

<p>There are no quite satisfactory statistics as to the number
of cases of lead poisoning in smelting works. Nevertheless,
a number of recent publications give valuable
data for certain smelting works in Germany, Austria, and
Hungary.</p>

<p>From details<a href="#endnote118" id="endnote-ref118"><span class="endnote-marker">6</span></a> of lead poisoning at Tarnowitz it would
appear that the conditions have materially improved since
1884, the cases having declined from 32·7 per 100 employed in
1884 to 6·2 in 1894 and 1895. The following figures show the
proportion affected in the different processes in the years 1901

<p>In one smelting works the percentage attack rate was 17·8
in 1901, and 27·1 in 1902. Here the number of workers had
increased from 73 in 1901 to 129 in 1902, and the absolute and
relative increase probably has relation to the well-known fact
that newly employed untrained workers become affected.
Similar incidence according to process can be given for the
Friedrich’s smelting works during the years 1903-1905:</p>

<p>Among 3028 cases of lead poisoning treated between 1853
and 1882 in smelting works near Freiberg (Saxony) gastric
symptoms were present in 1541, rheumatic pains in 215,
cerebral symptoms in 144, paralysis in 58, and lead colic in 426.</p>

<p>The recent reports of the German factory inspectors
point still to rather high incidence in many lead smelting
works. Thus in the district of Aix la Chapelle in 1909 there
were sixty cases involving 1047 sick days, as compared with
58 and 878 in 1908.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>In a well-arranged smelting works near Wiesbaden fifty-two
and forty-two cases were reported in 1908 and 1909 respectively,
among about 400 persons employed. This relatively high
number was believed to be closely connected with frequent
change in the <i>personnel</i>. Introduction of the Huntingdon-Heberlein
method is thought to have exercised an unfavourable
influence.</p>

<p>Other smelting works in Germany appear to have a relatively
small number of reported cases. Thus in 1909 among
550 workers employed in four smelting works in the Hildesheim
district only four cases were reported, and in the district of
Potsdam among 600 smelters only five were found affected on
medical examination. There is no doubt that many of the
cases described as gastric catarrh are attributable to lead.
Full information as to the conditions in Austria is contained
in the publication of the Imperial Labour Statistical Bureau.
In this comprehensive work the conditions in smelting works
are described. In the lead smelting works at Przibram the
cases had dropped from an average of 38·2 among the 4000-5000
persons employed to twenty-two in 1894 and to six in
1903, but only the severer cases are included. No single case
has occurred among the 350-450 persons engaged in mining
the ore, as galena (lead sulphide) is practically non-poisonous.
It was found, for example, that 50 per cent. of the furnace men
had (according to their statement) suffered from lead colic.
Of eight employed in the Pattinson process, seven stated they
had suffered from colic. The lead smelting works in Gailitz
showed marked frequency of lead poisoning—here the appointed
surgeon attributed anæmia and gastric and intestinal catarrh
to lead:</p>

<p>At Selmeczbanya a diminution from 196 cases in 1899
(50·7 per cent.) to six (2·2 per cent.) in 1905 had taken place.
These figures point clearly to the success of the hygienic

1896-1901, among 3780 persons employed, there were eighty-three

<p>In thirty-two spelter works in the district of Oppeln in the
year 1905, among 4789 spelter workers proper, there were
50 cases of colic, 18 of kidney disease, 223 of gastric and
intestinal catarrh, 40 of anæmia, and 612 of rheumatism, and
among 1159 calciners 1 case of colic, 2 of kidney disease,
47 of gastric catarrh, 2 of anæmia, and 134 of rheumatism.
Cases are much more numerous in spelter works where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Swedish blende containing lead is worked. It is remarkable,
however, that in large spelter works in Upper Silesia, where
for years no cases of lead poisoning were reported, medical
examination showed that 20·5 per cent. had signs of lead
absorption.</p>

<h5>White Lead and Lead Colours</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Manufacture.</span>—The primitive Dutch process consisted in
placing lead grids in earthenware pots containing dilute
acetic acid and covering them with tan bark. Fermentation
ensued with evolution of carbonic acid gas and increase in
temperature. The acetic acid vapour forms, with aid of
atmospheric oxygen, first basic lead acetate, which, by the
action of the carbonic acid gas, becomes converted into white
lead and neutral lead acetate. The product is crushed, sieved,
and dried. In the German or Austrian process thin sheets of
metallic lead are hung saddle-wise in chambers. Acetic acid
vapour and carbonic acid gas (produced by burning coke)
are led in from below. The chamber is then sealed and kept
so for a considerable time. When the chamber is ‘ripe’ the
white lead that has formed is taken out, freed from uncorroded
lead by spraying, dried, finely ground, and packed. White
lead comes on the market either as a powder or incorporated
with oil. Of the remaining lead colours, red lead (Pb₃O₄) is
much used. It is produced by heating lead oxide in reverberatory
furnaces with access of air and stirring.</p>

<h5>Lead Poisoning in the Manufacture of White Lead and
Lead Colours</h5>

<p>The manufacture by the German process may be divided
into three categories according to the degree of risk run:</p>

<p>1. The most dangerous processes are hanging the plates
in the chambers, work at the filter press, drying, pulverising,
and packing by hand.</p>

<p>2. Less dangerous are transport to the washer, washing, and
grinding.</p>

<p>3. Relatively the least dangerous are casting the plates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
transport of them to the chambers, drying, mechanical packing,
and mixing with oil.</p>

<p>The number of cases of lead poisoning in white lead factories
is often relatively great despite regulations. Casual labourers
especially run the greatest risk. This is frequently brought
out in the reports of the German factory inspectors, who
connect the high proportion of cases directly with the large
number of unskilled workers. Regulations are really only
successful in factories with regular employment.</p>

<p>This has been found also in Great Britain, where the Medical
Inspector of Factories showed that the cases among regular
workers numbered 6 per cent. and among casual workers
39 per cent.</p>

<p>The following table gives particulars as to the occurrence of
lead poisoning in the white lead factories in the district of
Cologne in 1904, some of which have admirable hygienic
arrangements:</p>

<p>It is worth noting that cases of lead poisoning have been
reported in the manufacture of zinc white, as, for example, in
Bohemia in 1907 and 1908.</p>

<h5>USE OF LEAD COLOURS AND PAINTS (HOUSE PAINTERS,
DECORATORS, ETC.)</h5>

<p>Use of lead colours, especially by painters and decorators,
causes relatively much lead poisoning. Apart from ignorance
of danger on the part of the worker, and lack of personal
cleanliness, unsuitable methods of working add to the danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
especially dry rubbing of painted surfaces, which gives rise to
much dust containing lead. Again, the crushing and mixing
of lumps of white lead and rubbing lead colours with the
hand are very dangerous.</p>

<p>The following German and Austrian figures enable conclusions
to be drawn as to the frequency of lead poisoning among
painters. In the sick insurance societies of Frankfurt-a-M.
in 1903 of every 100 painters 11·6 suffered from an attack of
lead poisoning. The similar sick insurance society of painters
in Berlin has kept useful statistics which are given in the
following table for the ten years 1900-9:</p>

<p>This shows that lead poisoning among the painters of
Berlin is happily diminishing, which may be attributed to
recent regulations. The society, however, complains in its
reports that not all cases of lead appear as such in their statistics,
and believes that all diseases entered as rheumatism, gastric
catarrh, nervous complaints, heart and kidney disease, should
be regarded as associated with lead. The kinds of work in
which painters suffer most are painting iron girders and
machines, sheet metal and iron furniture, railway waggons,
agricultural implements, coach painting, cabinet-making, shipbuilding,
and the use of red and white lead. The use of
lead colours, <i>lead acetate</i>, and <i>lead chromate</i> often give rise to
lead poisoning. Colours containing lead are not infrequently
used in the textile industry in dyeing, printing, and finishing.
White lead has been used for weighting the weft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Teleky has described cases of lead poisoning in which <i>silk
thread</i> was weighted with acetate of lead. As a consequence
a number of women engaged in sewing on fringes with the
thread suffered. The English factory inspectors’ reports
describe cases from manipulating <i>yarn dyed with chromate of
lead</i>.<a href="#endnote119" id="endnote-ref119"><span class="endnote-marker">7</span></a> </p>

<p><i>Chromate of lead</i> and <i>white lead</i> are used in colouring oil-cloth,
artificial flowers, paper, rubber goods, pencils, penholders,
socks, sealing-wax, candles, and stamps.</p>

<h5>USE OF LEAD IN THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY</h5>

<p>Lead poisoning has been frequently observed in such
branches of the chemical industry as require large leaden or
lead-lined vessels and pipes: the persons affected are principally
those engaged in lead burning.</p>

<p>Risk is considerable in manufacture of lead acetate. The
most dangerous processes are drying and packing the crystals.</p>

<h4>MANUFACTURE OF ELECTRIC ACCUMULATORS</h4>

<p>The manufacture of accumulators begins with the casting
of lead plates, which are then polished and dressed. Next
follows ‘pasting,’ that is, smearing the negative plate with a
paste of litharge, the positive plate being ‘formed’ by having an
electric current passed through so that the lead is converted
into spongy peroxide. The wooden boxes in which the plates
are assembled are lead-lined.</p>

<p>The most dangerous processes are casting, wire-brushing,
and pasting—the latter especially when done by hand.</p>

<p>In the years 1908 and 1909 among about 761 workers
employed in the accumulator factories of Cologne there were
fifty-six cases of lead colic and seventy-nine of gastric and
intestinal catarrh. Further figures for German accumulator
works show that in the two largest accumulator factories in
the district of Potsdam employing 142 workers there were
fifteen cases in 1904. In Great Britain, in the ten years 1900-1909,
285 cases were reported—an average of about thirty a
year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CERAMIC INDUSTRY</h4>

<p>Risk is present in several branches of the ceramic industry.
It is greatest in glazing earthenware, but not infrequent
also in the porcelain and glass industries. It is impossible
to deal with the extensive literature on this subject exhaustively.
A comprehensive and detailed survey of lead
poisoning in the ceramic industry on the Continent is that by
Kaup. Distinction is made between leadless glazes which melt
at high temperature and lead glazes which have the advantage
of a low melting-point. Galena and litharge are used in the
preparation of glazes for common earthenware and red and
white lead for ware of better quality. Distinction has to be
made between a lead silicious glaze for pottery ware, a lead and
boric acid glaze for stoneware, and a lead and zinc oxide glaze
for ordinary faience and stoneware. Seegar, the celebrated
expert, praises the advantage of lead glaze and the use of lead
in the ceramic industry—it is indeed practically indispensable—and
speaks of the poisonous nature of lead as its only fault.
The components of the glaze must have definite relation to
the hardness or softness of the body. The higher the proportion
of silicic acid in the glaze the harder the firing it will
stand; the more the flux materials are in excess the lower will
the melting point be.</p>

<p>The most important flux materials are, arranged in order of
decreasing fusibility, lead oxide, baryta, potash, soda, zinc
oxide, chalk, magnesia, and clay.</p>

<p>The <i>glaze</i> is made by first mixing the ingredients dry, and
then either fritting them by fluxing in a reverberatory furnace
and finally grinding them very finely in water or using the
raw material direct. In the fritting process in the case of the
lead glazes the soluble lead compounds become converted
into less soluble lead silicates and double silicates.</p>

<p>The glaze is applied in different ways—dipping, pouring,
dusting, blowing, and volatilising. Air-dried and biscuited
objects are dipped; pouring the glaze on is practised in coarse
ware, roofing-tiles, &amp;c.; dusting (with dry finely ground glaze,
litharge, or red lead) also in common ware; glaze-blowing
(aerographing) and glaze dusting on porcelain. In these
processes machines can be used. Bricks are only occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
glazed with glazes of felspar, kaolin, and quartz, to which lead
oxide is often added in very large quantity. Lead poisoning in
<i>brick works</i> in view of the infrequent use of lead is not common,
but when lead is used cases are frequent. Kaup quotes several
cases from the factory inspectors’ reports: thus in three roof-tiling
works examination by the district physician showed
that almost all the workers were affected.</p>

<p><i>Coarse ware pottery</i> is made of pervious non-transparent
clay with earthy fracture—only a portion of this class of ware
(stoneware) is made of raw materials which fire white. Such
ware generally receives a colourless glaze. The clay is shaped
on the potter’s wheel, and is then fired once or, in the better
qualities, twice.</p>

<p>Grinding the ingredients of the glaze is still often done in
primitive fashion in mortars. The glaze is usually composed
of lead oxide and sand, often with addition of other lead compounds
as, for example, in quite common ware, of equal parts
of litharge, clay, and coarse sand. Sometimes, instead of
litharge, galena (lead sulphide) or, with better qualities of
ware, red lead or ‘lead ashes’ are used.</p>

<p>The grinding of the glazes in open mills or even in mortars
constitutes a great danger which can be prevented almost
entirely by grinding in ball mills. The glaze material is next
mixed with water, and the articles are either dipped into
the creamy mass or this is poured over them. In doing
this the hands, clothes, and floors are splashed. The more
dangerous dusting-on of glaze is rarely practised. Occasionally
mechanical appliances take the place of hand dipping. Placing
the ware in the glost oven is done without placing it first in
saggars.</p>

<p>In the better qualities of pottery cooking utensils, which are
fired twice, a less fusible fritted lead glaze is generally used.
Coloured glaze contains, besides the colouring metallic oxides,
30-40 per cent. of litharge or red lead.</p>

<p>As Kaup shows, Continental factory inspectors’ reports
make only isolated references to occurrence of lead poisoning
in potteries. Insight into the conditions in small potteries is
obtained only from the Bavarian reports. In Upper Bavaria
ninety-three potteries employ 157 persons who come into
contact with lead glaze. Eleven cases were known to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
occurred in the last four years. Teleky found thirty-six cases
of lead poisoning (mostly among glostplacers) in the records
of the Potters’ Sick Insurance Society of Vienna.</p>

<p>Chyzer has described the striking conditions in Hungary.
There there are about 4000 potters, of whom 500 come into
contact with lead glaze. Chronic lead poisoning is rife
among those carrying on the occupation as a home industry.
Members of the family contract the disease from the dust in
the living rooms. This dust was found to contain from
0·5 to 8·7 per cent. of lead.</p>

<p>In the china and earthenware factories in Great Britain, in
the ten years 1900-9, 1065 cases with fifty-seven deaths were
reported.</p>

<p><i>Manufacture of stove tiles.</i>—The application of glaze to
stove tiles is done in different ways. The two most important
kinds are (1) fired tiles and (2) slipped tiles. In the production
of fired tiles a lead-tin alloy consisting of 100 parts lead and
30-36 parts tin—so-called ‘calcine’—are melted together in fireclay
reverberatory or muffle furnaces and raked about when at
a dull red heat so as to effect complete oxidation. The material
when cool is mixed with the same quantity of sand and
some salt, melted in the frit kiln, subsequently crushed,
ground, mixed with water, and applied to the previously fired
tiles. In this process risk is considerable. Presence of lead in
the air has been demonstrated even in well-appointed ‘calcine’
rooms. In unsuitably arranged rooms it was estimated that
in a twelve-hour day a worker would inhale 0·6 gramme of
lead oxide and that 3-8 grammes would collect on the clothes.</p>

<p><i>Slipped tiles</i> are made in Meissen, Silesia, Bavaria, and
Austria by first applying to them a mixture of clay and china
clay. The glaze applied is very rich in lead, containing 50-60
parts of red lead or litharge. Generally the glaze is applied
direct to the unfired tiles and fired once. Figures as to occurrence
of poisoning in Germany are quoted by Kaup from the
towns of Velten and Meissen. Among from 1748 to 2500
persons employed thirty-four cases were reported in the five
years 1901-5. Thirteen cases were reported as occurring in
the three largest factories in Meissen in 1906.</p>

<p>From other districts similar occurrence of poisoning is
reported. In Bohemia in a single factory in 1906 there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fourteen cases with one death, in another in 1907 there were
fourteen, and in 1908 twelve cases; eight further cases occurred
among majolica painters in 1908.</p>

<p><i>Stoneware and porcelain.</i>—Hard stoneware on a base of
clay, limestone, and felspar has usually a transparent lead glaze
of double earth silicates of lead and alkalis, with generally boric
acid to lower the fusing-point; the lead is nearly always added
in the form of red lead or litharge. The portion of the glaze
soluble in water is fritted, and forms, when mixed with the insoluble
portion, the glaze ready for use. The frit according to
Kaup contains from 16 to 18 per cent. of red lead, and the added
material (the mill mixing) 8-26 parts of white lead; the glaze
contains from 13 to 28 parts of lead oxide. The ware is dipped
or the glaze is sometimes aerographed on. Ware-cleaning by
hand (smoothing or levelling the surface with brushes, knives,
&amp;c.) is very dangerous work unless carried out under an
efficient exhaust. Colouring the body itself is done with
coloured metal oxides or by applying clay (slipping) or by the
direct application of colours either under or over the glaze.
Some of the under-glaze colours (by addition of chrome yellow
or nitrate of lead or red lead) contain lead and are applied
with the brush or aerograph or in the form of transfers.</p>

<p><i>Plain earthenware</i> is either not glazed or salt glazed; only
when decorated does it sometimes receive an acid lead glaze.</p>

<p><i>Porcelain</i> receives a leadless glaze of difficultly fusible
silicate (quartz sand, china clay, felspar). Risk is here confined
to painting with lead fluxes (enamel colours) containing
lead. These fluxes are readily fusible glasses made of
silicic acid, boric acid, lead oxide, and alkalis, and contain
much lead (60-80 per cent. of red lead).</p>

<p>In the <i>glass industry</i> lead poisoning may occur from use of
red lead as one of the essential ingredients. In Great Britain,
in the years 1900-9, forty-eight cases were reported in glass
polishing from use of putty powder.</p>

<h4>LETTERPRESS PRINTING, ETC.</h4>

<p>Type metal consists of about 67 per cent. lead, 27 per cent.
antimony, and 6 per cent. tin, but sometimes of 75 per cent.
lead, 23 per cent. antimony, and 2 per cent. tin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The actual printer comes least of all in contact with lead.
Use of lead colours (white lead, chromate of lead, &amp;c.) may
be a source of danger, especially in the preparation of printing
inks from them and in cleaning the printing rolls. A further,
if slight, danger arises from the use of bronze powder consisting
of copper, zinc, and tin. The two last-named metals contain
from 0·1 to 0·5 per cent. of lead, and in the application and
brushing off of the bronze there is a slight risk.</p>

<p>The compositor is exposed to constant danger from handling
the type and disturbing the dust in the cases. This dust may
contain from 15 to 38 per cent. of lead. Blowing the dust out
of the cases with bellows is especially dangerous, and want of
cleanliness (eating and smoking in the workroom) contributes
to the risk.</p>

<p>Type founders and persons engaged in rubbing and preparing
the type suffer. Introduction of type-casting machines
(linotype, monotype) has lessened the danger considerably.</p>

<p>No lead fumes are developed, as a temperature sufficiently
high to produce them is never reached. In all the processes,
therefore, it is lead dust which has to be considered.</p>

<p>The following figures of the Imperial Statistical Office as
to occurrence of lead poisoning among printers in Vienna
indicate the relative danger:</p>

<p>In Bohemia there is reference to thirty-eight cases in letterpress
printing in 1907 and twenty-seven in 1908.</p>

<p>Among 5693 persons treated for lead poisoning between
the years 1898 and 1901 in hospitals in Prussia, 222 were letterpress
printers.</p>

<p>Between 1900 and 1909 in Great Britain 200 cases of lead
poisoning were reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<h4>VARIOUS BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY</h4>

<p>The number of industries using lead is very large. Layet
as long ago as 1876 enumerated 111. We, however, limit ourselves
to those in which the risk is considerable.</p>

<p>Use of <i>lead beds</i> in <i>file-cutting</i> has given rise to many cases.
Further, to harden the file it is dipped into a bath of molten
lead. From 3 to 6 per cent. of lead has been found in the dust
in rooms where hardening is done.</p>

<p>Of 7000 persons employed in file-cutting in the German
Empire in the years 1901-5 on an average 30·5 or 0·43 per
cent. were affected yearly. In Great Britain 211 cases were
reported in the years 1900-9.</p>

<p>In <i>polishing precious stones</i> formerly many cases of lead
poisoning occurred, the reason being that the polishers come
into contact with particles of lead and fix the diamonds to be
polished in a vice composed of an alloy of lead and tin. Danger
is increased when the stones are actually polished on revolving
leaden discs. In Bohemia granite polishing used to be done in
this way, but is now replaced in many factories by carborundum
(silicon carbide).</p>

<p>Musical instrument making in Bohemia in the years
1906-8 was found regularly to give rise to cases of lead
poisoning from use of molten lead in filling them with a view to
shaping and bending. In lead pipe and organ pipe works,
lead burning, plumbing, &amp;c., considerable risk is run.</p>

<p>Often the causes of lead poisoning are difficult to discover,
and, when found, surprising. Thus shoemakers have suffered
from holding leaden nails in the mouth. Again, cases in women
have been reported from cutting out artificial flowers or paper
articles with aid of lead patterns, or counting stamps printed
in lead colours.<a href="#endnote120" id="endnote-ref120"><span class="endnote-marker">8</span></a> </p>

<h4>MERCURY</h4>

<p>As metallic mercury gives off vapour even at ordinary
temperatures, poisoning can occur not only in the recovery of
the metal from the ore, but also in all processes in which it is
used.</p>

<p>Chronic industrial poisoning occurs principally in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
preparation and use of mercury salts, in recovery of the metal
itself and of other metals with use of an amalgam, in water
gilding, from use of nitrate of mercury in the preparation of
rabbit fur for felt hat making, from use of mercury pumps
in producing the vacuum in electric filament lamps, and in
making barometers and thermometers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>—Mercury is obtained by roasting cinnabar
(sulphide of mercury). When cinnabar is heated with access
of air the sulphide burns to sulphur dioxide and the mercury
volatilises and is subsequently condensed. Formerly the
process was carried on in open hearths; now it is done usually
in blast furnaces. The mercury is condensed in Idria in large
chambers cooled with water, while at Almaden in Spain it is
collected in a series of small earthenware receptacles (aludels),
from small openings in which the mercury flows in gutters and
collects. The mercury so recovered is usually redistilled.</p>

<p>On the walls of the condensers a deposit of sulphide and
oxide of mercury collects, removal of which is one of the
operations most attended with risk.</p>

<p>Recovery of silver or gold by amalgamation with mercury
is carried on only in America. The metallic silver or gold
is taken up by the mercury, from which it is recovered by
distillation.</p>

<p>The conditions in the quicksilver mines of Idria in Austria
have improved of late years. Thus in the five years prior to
1886 of 500 cases of illness more than 11 per cent. were due
to chronic mercurial poisoning. In 1906, 209 persons were
employed, of whom only one-third were permanent hands.
Among these the sickness rate was very high (95-104 per
cent.). Of 741 cases of illness among the miners there were
six of mercury poisoning, and of 179 among persons employed
in recovery of the metal, twelve cases.<a href="#endnote121" id="endnote-ref121"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> </p>

<p>The conditions of employment in the cinnabar mines of
Monte Amiata in Italy have recently been described in detail.<a href="#endnote122" id="endnote-ref122"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a>
Here, although the recovery of the metal is carried out in
modern furnaces, thus greatly reducing the danger, nevertheless
nearly all the furnace workers suffer from chronic poisoning.</p>

<p>In <i>silvering of mirrors</i> the leaf of tinfoil was spread out
on an inclined table; mercury was poured over it and the
sheet of glass laid on the top with weights. The superfluous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
mercury was squeezed out and ran away owing to the sloping
position of the table. Now this process, even in Fürth, is
almost entirely replaced by the nitrate of silver and ammonia
process. Years ago the number of cases of poisoning was
very serious in places where, as in Fürth, the work was
carried on as a home industry.</p>

<p>In the production of <i>incandescent electric bulbs</i> danger arises
from breaking of the glass pipes of the pumps and scattering
of mercury on the floor of the workrooms. Since there is
a growing tendency to replace mercury pumps by air pumps
such cases ought to become rare.</p>

<p>In <i>water gilding</i>—a process little employed now—the
metal objects (military buttons, &amp;c.) to be gilded, after treatment
with a flux, are brushed over with the mercury amalgam,
and subsequently fired to drive off the mercury. Unless
careful provision is made to carry away the vapour chronic
poisoning cannot fail to occur. Even sweeps have been affected
after cleaning the chimneys of water gilders’ workshops. In
Great Britain, between 1899 and 1905, six cases were reported
among water gilders.</p>

<p>In the <i>manufacture of barometers</i> and thermometers mercury
poisoning is not infrequent. Between 1899 and 1905 sixteen
such cases were reported in England; during the same period
there were seventeen cases among those putting together
electrical meters.</p>

<p>Risk of mercurial poisoning is constantly present in <i>hatters’
furriers’ processes</i> and in subsequent processes in felt hat
factories. The risk from use of nitrate of mercury is considerable
to those brushing the rabbit skins with the solution
(carotting), and subsequently drying, brushing, cutting,
locking, and packing them. According to Hencke in 100
kilos of the carotting liquid there are 20 kilos of mercury.
In England, in the years 1899-1905, thirteen cases of
mercurial poisoning were reported in hatters’ furriers’ processes.
Among eighty-one persons so employed the medical
inspector found twenty-seven with very defective teeth as
the result of the employment, and seventeen with marked
tremor.</p>

<p>In the <i>manufacture of mercurial salts</i> poisoning occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
chiefly when they are made by sublimation, as in the
manufacture of vermilion, of corrosive sublimate (when
mercurous sulphate is sublimed with salt), and in the preparation
of calomel (when sublimate ground with mercury or
mercurous sulphate mixed with mercury and salt is sublimed).
Between 1899 and 1905 in England seven cases were
reported from chemical works. As to occurrence of mercury
poisoning from <i>fulminate of mercury</i>, see the chapter on
Explosives.</p>

<h4>ARSENIC</h4>

<p>Chronic industrial <i>arsenical poisoning</i>, both as to origin and
course, is markedly different from the acute form.</p>

<p>The chronic form arises mainly from inhalation of minute
quantities of metallic arsenic or its compounds in recovery from
the ore, or from the use of arsenic compounds in the manufacture
of colours, in tanyards, and in glass making. Acute
industrial <i>arseniuretted hydrogen poisoning</i> is especially likely
to occur where metals and acids react on one another and
either the metal or the acid contains arsenic in appreciable
amount. Further, arseniuretted hydrogen may be contained
in gases given off in smelting operations and in chemical
processes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recovery of Arsenic and White Arsenic.</span>—Pure
arsenic is obtained from native cobalt and arsenical pyrites
by volatilisation on roasting the ore in the absence of air.
After the furnace has been charged sheet iron condensing tubes
are affixed to the mouths of the retorts, which project out of
the furnace, and to these again iron or earthenware prolongs.
Arsenic condenses on the sides of the sheet metal tubes and
amorphous arsenic, oxides, and sulphides in the prolongs.
After sublimation has been completed the contents of the
prolongs are removed and used for production of other arsenic
compounds; the (generally) argentiferous residues in the retorts
are removed and further treated in silver smelting works;
finally, the crusts of crystalline arsenic (artificial fly powder)
are knocked out from the carefully unrolled sheet iron tubes.</p>

<p>As can be readily understood from the description opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of poisoning from volatilisation of arsenic and of
arsenic compounds is considerable. Metallic arsenic is used
for making hard shot, and for increasing the brilliancy and
hardness of metal alloys (type metal, &amp;c.).</p>

<p><i>White arsenic</i> (arsenic trioxide) is obtained by roasting
with access of air in reverberatory furnaces arsenical ores and
smelting residues. The vapours of white arsenic sublime
and are condensed as a powder in long walled channels or
in chambers, and are resublimed in iron cylinders. White
arsenic is used in making colours, in glass (for decolourising
purposes), as an insecticide in the stuffing of animals, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Industrial Arsenic Poisoning.</span>—In the <i>extraction of
arsenic</i> and preparation of arsenious acid danger is present.
But reliable accounts in literature of poisoning among those
engaged in arsenic works are wanting.</p>

<p>Those engaged in roasting operations and packing suffer
much from skin affections. Similar poisoning is reported in
the smelting of other arsenical ores—nickel, cobalt, lead,
copper, iron, and silver, from arsenic compounds present in
the fumes. This is especially the case in the smelting of
tin, which generally contains arsenical pyrites.</p>

<p>Danger is present also in <i>unhairing</i> (i.e. removing the
wool from sheep skins), since the skins imported from Buenos
Aires and Monte Video are treated with a preservative which,
in addition to sodium nitrate, soda, and potash, contains
generally arsenious acid.</p>

<p>In <i>tanneries</i> a mixture of arsenic sulphide (realgar) and lime
is used for unhairing. Arsenic is used also for preserving
and stuffing animal furs; but although affections of the skin are
described I cannot find reference to arsenical poisoning.</p>

<p>The inspector for East London in 1905 refers to severe
eczematous eruptions on face, neck, and hands, affecting
workers in a <i>sheep dip</i> works—mainly in the packing of the
light powder in packets.</p>

<p>Formerly the use of arsenic in the manufacture of colours
was great, especially of <i>emerald (Schweinfurter) green</i>. This
is made by dissolving arsenious acid in potash with addition of
acetate of copper. Drying and grinding the material constitute
the main danger. Scheele’s green is another arsenical colour.</p>

<p>Use of <i>arsenic colours</i> is becoming less and less. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
colour printing of paper and colouring of chalk they are still
employed. They are used, too, as mordants in dyeing, but
cases of poisoning from these sources in recent years are not
to be found.</p>

<p>The dust in many glass works contains, it is stated, as much
as 1·5 per cent of white arsenic.</p>

<p>Despite the numerous opportunities for arsenical poisoning
in industries it is rare or, at any rate, is only rarely reported.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arseniuretted Hydrogen Poisoning.</span>—Industrial poisoning
from arseniuretted hydrogen is caused mostly by inhalation
of the gases developed by the action on one another of acids
and metals which contain arsenic. Hydrogen gas as usually
prepared for filling balloons gives occasion for poisoning.</p>

<p>In Breslau in 1902 five workmen became affected, of whom
three died from inhalation of arseniuretted hydrogen gas in
filling toy balloons.<a href="#endnote123" id="endnote-ref123"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> </p>

<p>Further, use of hydrogen in lead burning may expose to
risk, and also preparation of zinc chloride flux.</p>

<p>Of thirty-nine recorded cases of arseniuretted hydrogen
poisoning twelve were chemists, eleven workers filling toy
balloons, seven aniline workers, five lead smelters, three balloonists,
and in one the origin could not be traced. Nineteen of
these proved fatal within from three to twenty-four days.<a href="#endnote124" id="endnote-ref124"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> </p>

<p>Cases are recorded (1) in the reduction of nitroso-methylaniline
with zinc and hydrochloric acid; (2) in the preparation
of zinc chloride from zinc ashes and hydrochloric acid;
(3) from manufacture of zinc sulphate from crude sulphuric
acid and zinc dust; (4) in spelter works in the refining of
silver from the zinc crust with impure hydrochloric acid; and
(5) in the formation room of accumulator factories.</p>

<p>The English factory inspectors’ report describes in 1906
occurrence of three cases in an electrolytic process for the
recovery of copper in which the copper dissolved in sulphuric
acid was deposited at the cathode, and hydrogen at the lead
anode. In the 1907 report mention is made of two cases, one
affecting a chemist separating bismuth from a solution of
bismuth chloride in hydrochloric acid, and the other (which
proved fatal) a man who had cleaned a vitriol tank.</p>

<p>The poisoning resulting from ferro-silicon is in part referable
to development of arseniuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<h4>ANTIMONY</h4>

<p>It seems doubtful if industrial poisoning can really be
traced to antimony or its compounds; generally the arsenic
present with the antimony is at fault. Erben<a href="#endnote125" id="endnote-ref125"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> considers that
industrial antimony poisoning occurs among workmen employed
in smelting antimony alloys in making tartar emetic through
inhalation of fumes of oxide of antimony.</p>

<p>A case is cited of a workman in Hamburg engaged in pulverising
pure antimony who was attacked with vomiting
which lasted for several days, and the inspector of factories
noted epistaxis (nose bleeding) and vomiting as following on
the crushing of antimony ore.</p>

<p>Compositors in addition to chronic lead poisoning may
suffer, it is alleged, from chronic antimony poisoning, showing
itself in diminution in the number of white blood corpuscles
and marked eosinophilia. These changes in the blood could
be brought about experimentally in rabbits. Antimony was
found by the Marsh test in the stools of those affected.</p>

<h4>IRON</h4>

<p><i>Pig iron</i> is obtained by smelting iron ores in blast furnaces
(<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>), through the upper opening of which charges of ore,
limestone or similar material to act as a flux, and coke are
fed in succession. The furnaces are worked continuously,
using a blast of heated air; carbon monoxide is produced
and effects the reduction of the ore to molten iron. The
latter accumulates in the hearth and is covered with molten
slag; this flows constantly away through an opening and is
collected in slag bogies for removal, or is sometimes cooled in
water.</p>

<p>The crude iron is tapped from time to time, and is led in
a fluid condition into moulds called ‘pigs,’ in which it
solidifies. Cast iron is occasionally used direct from the blast
furnace for the purpose of making rough castings, but
generally it is further refined before being used in a foundry
by remelting with cast iron scrap in a cupola furnace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wrought iron</i> is made by treating pig iron in refinery and
puddling furnaces; in these much of the carbon is removed
as carbon monoxide, and from the puddling furnace the iron
is obtained as a pasty mass which can be worked into bars,
rods, or plates.</p>

<p><i>Steel</i> is made in various ways. The Acid Bessemer process
consists in forcing compressed air in numerous small streams
through molten cast iron, in iron vessels (converters) which
are lined with ganister, a silicious sandstone. These can
be rotated on trunnions. Basic Bessemer steel is made in
similar converters by the Thomas-Gilchrist or basic process,
which can be applied to pig irons containing phosphorus.
The latter is removed by giving the converter a basic lining
of calcined magnesium limestone mixed with tar.</p>

<p>In the <i>Martin</i> process steel is obtained by melting together
pig iron with steel scrap, wrought iron scrap, &amp;c., on the
hearth of a Siemens regenerative furnace with a silicious
lining.</p>

<p>In iron smelting the most important danger is from <i>blast
furnace gas</i> rich in carbonic oxide. Sulphur dioxide, hydrocyanic
acid, and arseniuretted hydrogen gas may possibly be
present.</p>

<p>When work was carried out in blast furnaces with open tops
the workers engaged in charging ran considerable risk. But
as the blast furnace gas is rich in carbonic oxide and has high
heating capacity these gases are now always led off and utilised;
the charging point is closed by a cup (Parry’s cup and cone
charger) and only opened from time to time mechanically,
when the workers retire so far from the opening as to be
unaffected by the escaping gas. The gas is led away (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>)
through a side opening into special gas mains, is subjected to
a purifying process in order to rid it of flue dust, and then used
to heat the blast, fire the boilers, or drive gas engines.</p>

<p>Severe blast furnace gas poisoning, however, does occur in
entering the mains for cleaning purposes. Numerous cases of
the kind are quoted in the section on Carbonic oxide poisoning.</p>

<p>The gases evolved on tapping and slag running can also
act injuriously, and unpleasant emanations be given off in
granulating the slag (by receiving the fluid slag in water).</p>

<p>In the puddling process much carbonic oxide is present.
Other processes, however, can scarcely give rise to poisoning.</p>

<p>The <i>basic slag</i> produced in the Thomas-Gilchrist process is a
valuable manure on account of the phosphorus it contains;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
it is ground in edge runners, and then reduced to a very fine
dust in mills and disintegrators. This dust has a corrosive
action already referred to in the chapter on Phosphorus and
Artificial Manures.</p>

<p>The poisoning caused by <i>ferro-silicon</i> is of interest. Iron
with high proportion of silicon has been made in recent years
on a large scale for production of steel. Some 4000 tons of
ferro-silicon are annually exported to Great Britain from
France and Germany. It is made by melting together iron ore,
quartz, coke, and lime (as flux) at very high temperature in
electrical furnaces. The coke reduces the quartz and ore to
silicon and metal with the production of ferro-silicon. Certain
grades, namely those with about 50 per cent. silicon, have
the property of decomposing or disintegrating into powder
on exposure for any length of time to the air, with production
of very poisonous gases containing phosphoretted and
arseniuretted hydrogen. The iron and quartz often contain
phosphates, which in presence of carbon and at the high
temperature of the electrical furnace would no doubt be
converted into phosphides combining with the lime to form
calcium phosphide; similarly any arsenic present would yield
calcium arsenide. These would be decomposed in presence of
water and evolve phosphoretted and arseniuretted hydrogen
gas. In addition to its poisonous properties it has also given
rise to explosions.</p>

<p>[In January 1905 fifty steerage passengers were made
seriously ill and eleven of them died. In 1907 five passengers
died on a Swedish steamer as the result of poisonous gases given
off from ferro-silicon, and more recently five lives were lost
on the steamer <i>Aston</i> carrying the material from Antwerp to
Grimsby.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> This accident led to full investigation of the
subject by Dr. Copeman, F.R.S., one of the Medical Inspectors
of the Local Government Board, Mr. S. R. Bennett, one of
H.M. Inspectors of Factories, and Dr. Wilson Hake, Ph.D.,
F.I.C., in which the conclusions arrived at are summarised as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Numerous accidents, fatal and otherwise, have been caused
within the last few years by the escape of poisonous and explosive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
gases from consignments of ferro-silicon, which, in every
instance, have been found to consist of so-called high-grade
ferro-silicon, produced in the electric furnace.</p>

<p>2. These accidents, for the most part, have occurred during
transport of the ferro-silicon by water, whether in sea-going
vessels or in barges and canal-boats plying on inland waters.</p>

<p>3. These accidents have occurred in various countries and
on vessels of different nationalities, while the ferro-silicon
carried has, in almost every instance, been the product of a
different manufactory.</p>

<p>4. Ferro-silicon, especially of grades containing from 40 per
cent. to 60 per cent. of silicon, is invariably found to evolve
considerable quantities of phosphoretted hydrogen gas, and,
in less amount, of arseniuretted hydrogen, both of which are
of a highly poisonous nature. A certain amount of the gas
evolved is present, as such, in the alloy, being ‘occluded’ in
minute spaces with which its substance is often permeated.</p>

<p>5. As the result of careful investigation, it has been shown
that certain grades of ferro-silicon—notably such as contain
about 33 per cent., 50 per cent., and 60 per cent. of silicon—even
when manufactured from fairly pure constituents, are
both brittle and liable to disintegrate spontaneously, this latter
characteristic being apt to be specially marked in the case of the
50 per cent. grade.</p>

<p>All these grades are commonly employed at the present time.</p>

<p>6. In the event of disintegration occurring, the amount of
surface exposed will, obviously, be greater than if the mass were
solid.</p>

<p>7. Evolution of poisonous gases is greatly increased by the
action of moisture, or of moist air, under the influence of which
phosphoretted hydrogen is generated from calcium phosphide,
which, in turn, is formed, in large part, at any rate, from the
calcium phosphate present in anthracite and quartz, at the high
temperature of the electric furnace. If spontaneous disintegration
of the alloy also occurs, much larger quantities of gas
would be given off from such friable and unstable material,
other conditions being equal. The greater or less tendency of
a given sample to evolve poisonous gases, and even a rough
estimate of their probable amount may be arrived at by the use
of test-papers prepared with silver nitrate.</p>

<p>8. There is no evidence that low-grade ferro-silicon (10 to
15 per cent.), produced in the blast-furnace, has ever given rise
to accidents of similar character to those known to have been
caused by the high-grade electrically produced alloy. Blast-furnace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ferro-silicon does not evolve poisonous gases even in
presence of moisture.</p>

<p>9. As regards ferro-silicon produced in the electric furnace,
the evidence available goes to show that certain percentage
grades are practically quite innocuous. This statement applies
to grades of alloy of a silicon content up to and including 30 per
cent., and probably also, though in considerably less degree, to
those of 70 per cent. and over.</p>

<p>10. In view of the fact that the use of ferro-silicon of grades
ranging between 30 per cent. and 70 per cent. apparently is not
essential in metallurgical operations, with the possible exception
of basic steel manufacture, it will be advisable that the production
of this alloy of grades ranging between these percentages
should be discontinued in the future.</p>

<p>11. The proprietors of iron and steel works making use of
ferro-silicon will assist in the protection of their workpeople,
and at the same time act for the public benefit by restricting
their orders to grades of this material, either not exceeding
30 per cent., or of 70 per cent. and upwards, according to the
special nature of their requirements.</p>

<p>12. But as, pending international agreement on the question,
intermediate percentages of ferro-silicon will doubtless continue
to be manufactured and sold, the issue, by the Board of Trade, of
special regulations will be necessary in order to obviate, so far as
may be possible, chance of further accidents during the transport
of this substance.</p>

<p><i>Inter alia</i>, these regulations should require a declaration of
the nature, percentage, date of manufacture, and place of origin
of any such consignment.</p>

</div>

<p>The suggested regulations are printed on p. <a href="#Page_291">291</a>.]</p>

<h4>ZINC</h4>

<p>Industrial poisoning from zinc is unknown. The chronic
zinc poisoning among spelter workers described by Schlockow
with nervous symptoms is undoubtedly to be attributed to
lead.</p>

<h4>COPPER: BRASS</h4>

<p><i>Occurrence of brass-founder’s ague.</i>—Opinion is divided as
to whether pure copper is poisonous or not. Lehmann has
at any rate shown experimentally that as an industrial poison
it is without importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Occurrence, however, of brass-founder’s ague is undoubtedly
frequent. Although neither pure zinc nor pure copper give rise
to poisoning, yet the pouring of brass (an alloy of zinc and
copper) sets up a peculiar train of symptoms. As the symptoms
are transient, and medical attendance is only very rarely
sought after, knowledge of its frequency is difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>Sigel,<a href="#endnote126" id="endnote-ref126"><span class="endnote-marker">1</span></a> who has experimented on himself, believes that the
symptoms result from inhalation of superheated zinc fumes.
In large well-appointed brass casting shops (as in those of
Zeiss in Jena) incidence is rare.</p>

<p>Lehmann<a href="#endnote127" id="endnote-ref127"><span class="endnote-marker">2</span></a> very recently has expressed his decided opinion
that brass-founder’s ague is a zinc poisoning due to inhalation
of zinc oxide and not zinc fumes. This conclusion he came to
as the result of experiments on a workman predisposed to
attacks of brass-founder’s ague. Lehmann’s surmise is that the
symptoms are due to an auto-intoxication from absorption
of dead epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, the cells
having been destroyed by inhalation of the zinc oxide. He
found that he could produce typical symptoms in a worker
by inhalation of the fumes given off in burning pure zinc.</p>

<p><i>Metal pickling.</i>—The object of metal dipping is to give
metal objects, especially of brass (buckles, lamps, electric
fittings, candlesticks, &amp;c.), a clean or mat surface and is
effected by dipping in baths of nitric, hydrochloric, or sulphuric
acid. Generally after dipping in the dilute bath the articles go
for one or two minutes into strong acid, from which injurious
fumes, especially nitrous fumes, develop with occasionally
fatal effect (see the chapter on Nitric Acid). Unfortunately,
there are no references in the literature of the subject as to
the frequency of such attacks.</p>

<p>Recovery of gold and silver has been already referred to
in the chapters on Mercury, Lead, and Cyanogen.</p>

<p>Mention must be made of <i>argyria</i>. This is not poisoning in
the proper sense of the word, as injury to health is hardly
caused. Argyria results from absorption of small doses of silver
salts which, excreted in the form of reduced metallic silver, give
the skin a shiny black colour. Cases are most frequently seen
in silverers of glass pearls who do the work by suction.
Local argyria has been described by Lewin in silvering of
mirrors and in photographers.</p>

<h3 id="III_OCCURRENCE_OF_INDUSTRIAL_POISONING">III. OCCURRENCE OF INDUSTRIAL POISONING
IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES</h3>

<p>The most important facts have now been stated as to the
occurrence of poisoning in industry, and there remain only a
few gaps to fill in and to survey briefly the risks in certain
important groups of industry.</p>

<h4>TREATMENT OF STONE AND EARTHS</h4>

<h5>Lime Burning: Glass Industry</h5>

<p>Lead poisoning in the ceramic industry (earthenware,
porcelain, glass, polishing of precious stones, &amp;c.) has been
dealt with in detail in the chapter on Lead. There is further
the possibility of chrome-ulceration, of arsenic poisoning, and
conceivably also of manganese. Further, poisoning by <i>carbonic
oxide</i> and carbon dioxide may occur from the escape of furnace
gases where hygienic conditions are bad. In charging lime
kilns poisoning by carbonic oxide has occurred. The report
of the Union of Chemical Industry in 1906 describes the case
of a workman who was assisting in filling the kiln with limestone.
As the furnace door was opened for the purpose gas
escaped in such amount as to render him unconscious. He
was picked up thirty minutes later, but efforts at resuscitation
failed.</p>

<p>Carbonic oxide poisoning, again, may arise from the use
of Siemens regenerative furnaces, especially glass furnaces:
details are given in the chapter on Illuminating Gas.</p>

<p><i>Hydrofluoric acid</i> is present as an industrial poison in
<i>glass etching</i> (see Fluorine Compounds). Persons employed in
this process suffer from inflammation of the respiratory tract
and ulceration of the skin of the hands. I could not find any
precise statement as to the frequency of the occurrence of
such injuries. Use of sand-blasting to roughen the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
glass has to some extent taken the place of etching by hydrofluoric
acid.</p>

<h4>TREATMENT OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS</h4>

<p>In <i>tanning</i> use of arsenic compounds for detaching the
wool from skins and of gas lime for getting rid of hair may
cause injury to health. With the latter there is possibility
of the action of cyanogen compounds (see the chapters on
Arsenic and Cyanogen).</p>

<h4>PREPARATION OF VEGETABLE FOOD STUFFS AND THE LIKE</h4>

<p>In <i>fermentation</i> processes as in breweries and the sugar
industry accumulations of carbonic acid gas occur, and suffocation
from this source has been repeatedly described. Mention in
this connection should be made of the use of salufer containing
some 2 per cent. of silicofluoric acid as a preservative and antiseptic
in beer brewing. In the <i>sulphuring</i> of hops, wine, &amp;c.,
the workers may run risk from the injurious action of sulphur
dioxide. <i>Arsenic</i> in the sulphuric acid used for the production
of <i>dextrine</i> may set up industrial poisoning. Poisoning from
<i>ammonia</i> gas can occur in <i>cold storage</i> premises. Industrial
poisoning from tobacco is not proved, but the injurious effect
of the aroma and dust of tobacco—especially in women—in
badly arranged tobacco factories is probable.</p>

<h4>WOOD WORKING</h4>

<p><i>Injurious woods.</i>—In recent literature there are several
interesting references to injury to health from certain poisonous
kinds of wood—skin affections in workers manipulating satinwood,
and affections of the heart and general health in workers
making shuttles of African boxwood. Details of these forms
of poisoning are reported from England and Bavaria. The
wood used for making the shuttles was West African boxwood
(Gonioma Kamassi). It appears that the wood contains an
alkaloidal poison which affects the heart’s action. The
workers suffered from headache, feeling of sleepiness, lachrymation,
coryza, difficulty of breathing, nausea, and weakness.
Four workers had to give up the work because of the difficulty
in breathing. Inquiry was made by Dr. John Hay of
Liverpool in 1908 and by the medical inspector of factories
in 1905. The following table shows the symptoms found:</p>

<p>The later inquiry shows considerable diminution in the
amount of complaint as to respiratory trouble. This may have
been due to the improved conditions of working, freely acknowledged
by the men. Men were examined who had complained
of the effects of the wood in 1905, and had continued uninterruptedly
at the same kind of work during the interval
without any obvious further injury to their health, although
they preferred working on other woods.</p>

<p>East Indian boxwood had to be discarded in the shuttle
trade owing to its irritant action on the eyes. Sabicu wood
from Cuba was stated to give off ‘a snuffy dust under the
machine and hand planes, the effect of which upon the worker
is to cause a running at the eyes and nose, and a general feeling
of cold in the head. The symptoms pass off in an hour or so
after discontinuance of work.’ Reference was made in the
report for 1906 to eczematous eruptions produced by so-called
Borneo rosewood, a wood used owing to its brilliant
colour and exquisite grain in fret-saw work. The Director
of the Imperial Institute experimented with this wood, but
failed to discover injurious properties in it. At the same time
experiments with the wood and sawdust of East and West
Indian satinwood were undertaken, but also without result.</p>

<p>From inquiries subsequently made it appeared that much
confusion existed as to the designation ‘satinwood,’ as under
this name were classed both East and West Indian satinwood
and also satin walnut. The evidence was clear that East
Indian satinwood was more irritating than West Indian.
Satin walnut wood is apparently harmless. In the shipbuilding
yards of East London, Glasgow, and Bristol affections
of the skin were recognised, but susceptibility to the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
varied. One man asserted that merely laying a shaving on
the back of his hand would produce a sore place. The injurious
effects here seem to disappear quickly. Exhaust ventilation is
applied, but there is a tendency to give up the use of the wood.</p>

<p>Isolated cases of illness have been ascribed to working teak
and olive wood. In Sheffield the following are held to be
irritating: ebony, magenta rosewood, West Indian boxwood,
cocos wood. Some kinds of mahogany are said to affect the
eyes and nose.</p>

<p>Use of methylated spirit in polishing furniture is said to
lead to injury to health although not to set up actual poisoning.
Lead poisoning can occur from the sand-papering of coats of
paint applied to wood.</p>

<p>In impregnating wood with creosote and tar the effects on
the skin noted in the chapter on Tar are observed.</p>

<h4>TEXTILE INDUSTRY</h4>

<p>In getting rid of the grease from animal wool carbon
bisulphide or <i>benzine</i> may be used.</p>

<p>The process of <i>carbonising</i> in the production of shoddy may
give rise to injury to health from acid fumes. Lead poisoning
used to be caused by the knocking together of the leaden
weights attached to the Jacquard looms. This is a thing of
the past, as now iron weights are universal.</p>

<p>Opportunity for lead poisoning is given in the weighting of
yarn—especially of silk with lead compounds.</p>

<p>In <i>bleaching</i> use of chlorine and sulphur dioxide has to be
borne in mind.</p>

<p>In <i>chemical cleaning</i> poisoning by benzine may occur.</p>

<p>In <i>dyeing</i> and <i>printing</i> use of poisonous colours is lessening,
as they have been supplanted by aniline colours. On occurrence
of aniline poisoning in aniline black dyeing see the section on
Aniline. Use of lead colours and of chromate of lead are dealt
with in special sections.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF
INDUSTRIAL POISONING</i></span></h2>

<p>In this section the most important diseases and symptoms
of industrial poisoning will be described. In doing this—considering
the mainly practical purpose of this book—theoretical
toxicological details and any full discussion of
disputed scientific points will be omitted.</p>

<h3 id="I_INTRODUCTORY">I. INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p>Hitherto in this book we have intentionally followed the
inductive method, from the particular to the general: we
began by citing a number of important instances of industrial
poisoning, but only now will endeavour be made to give a
definition of the terms ‘poison’ and ‘poisoning.’</p>

<p>Attempts at such definitions are numerous; every old and
new text-book of toxicology contains them. A few only hold
good for our purpose. It is characteristic that Lewin, after
attempting a definition of the conception ‘poisoning,’ himself
rejects it and declares that he can see no practical disadvantage
in the impossibility of defining this notion, because deductions
based upon the knowledge of undoubted cases can never be
dispensed with, even if a definition were possible: one justification
the more for our inductive method.</p>

<p>But we will not quite dispense with a definition.</p>

<p><i>Poisons are certain substances which are able chemically to
act on an organism in such a way as to effect a permanent
or transient injury to its organs and functions; an injury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
consequently to the health and well-being of the person affected;
this injury we call poisoning.</i></p>

<p>In the present book we have refrained from including
industrial infections among industrial poisonings, and the
subject has been limited to poisoning in the restricted and
current sense of the word.</p>

<p>An industrial poison is a poison employed, produced, or
somehow occasioned in industrial occupation, which is brought
about inadvertently, and consequently against the will of the
person poisoned.</p>

<p>From a simple survey of the action of industrial poisons in
general we may group them as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Poisons which act <i>superficially</i>, i.e. which cause in the
organs which they touch gross anatomical lesions
(irritation, corrosion, &amp;c.)—so-called contact-effect. To
this class belong especially irritant and corrosive
poisons.</p>

<p>2. <i>Blood</i> poisons, i.e. poisons which are absorbed by the
blood and change it; this change can affect either
the blood colouring-matter, with which certain poisons
form chemical compounds, or the blood corpuscles
themselves can be altered or destroyed (for instance,
poisons having a hæmolytic action).</p>

<p>3. Poisons with definite <i>internal</i> action, so-called remote
or specific effect. To this class belong the poisons
which, after being absorbed into the system, act upon
definite organs or tissues in a specific manner (nerve
poisons, heart poisons, &amp;c.).</p>

</div>

<p>It is indeed possible for one and the same poison to display
two or all three of these modes of action.</p>

<p>The effect of poison depends upon an interaction of the
poison and the organism, or its single organs. Selection as
regards quality and quantity is a property of the organism as
well as of the poison: the nature and amount of the poison
taken in are determining factors on the one side, and on the
other the constitution, size, and weight of the affected
organism. The chemical constitution of the poisonous substance
determines the qualitative property of the poison.</p>

<p>Further, certain physical properties of the poison determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
its action, especially its form, solubility in water, and its power
of dissolving fat. These affect its susceptibility to absorption,
to which point we shall return shortly; the hygroscopic
capacity of a poison produces a highly irritant and corrosive
action.</p>

<p>Industrial poisons can be absorbed (1) as solid substances,
(2) as liquids, and (3) as gases. Since industrial poisoning, as
defined above, is of course neither desired nor intended by the
sufferer, who unsuspectingly takes into his system poison used
or developed in the factory, solid substances in finely divided
condition—in the form of dust—can be considered as industrial
poisons. Accordingly, industrial poisons can be classed as due
to dust, gases, and liquids.</p>

<p>The poison may be introduced into the body through the
functional activity of the organism by the lungs or alimentary
tract, or it may penetrate the uninjured or injured surface of
the skin.</p>

<p>Industrial poisons which contaminate the air of the factory
are inhaled—these are consequently either poisonous dusts
or gases and vapours.</p>

<p>As a rule, only industrial poisons in a liquid form enter
through the skin, which may be either intact or wounded;
gaseous poisons seldom do; poisons in the form of fat or dust
can only pass through the skin after they have been first
dissolved by the secretions of the skin or of a wound, so that
they come to be absorbed in solution. Most frequently
those liquid poisons which are capable of dissolving the
fat of the skin are thus absorbed, and next, such liquids
as have a corrosive effect, breaking down the resistance
of the skin covering and producing an inflamed raw surface.
But such poisons much more easily enter through the mucous
membrane, as this naturally offers a much weaker resistance
than the skin.</p>

<p>From a quantitative point of view it is especially the
amount of poison actively assimilated which determines the
effect. Every poison is without effect if assimilated in correspondingly
small quantities. There is consequently a minimum
poisonous dose, after which the poison begins to act; but this
minimum dose can only be ascertained and specified when
the qualitative properties and the weight of the organism are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
also taken into consideration; it has therefore a relative value.
The strongest effect which a poison is able to produce is the
destruction of the life functions of the organism, the fatal
effect. This fatal dose, however, can only be determined
relatively to the qualities of the organism in question.</p>

<p>Not only is the absolute quality of the poison of decisive
significance, but the degree of concentration often influences
its action, that is to say, the greater or less amount of effective
poison contained in the substance conveying it into the
organism; concentration plays an important part in many
industrial poisons, especially, as is obvious, in corrosive
poisons.</p>

<p>A further important point is the time which it takes to
absorb the poison. The action of the poison—the whole expression
of the symptoms of poisoning—is essentially influenced
by this fact.</p>

<p>Usually gradual and repeated absorption of small quantities
produces slow onset of symptoms, while sudden absorption
of larger quantities of poison brings about rapid onset of
illness. In the former case the poisoning is called <i>chronic</i>,
in the latter, <i>acute</i>. Acute industrial poisoning is sometimes
so sudden that the affected person cannot withdraw himself
in time from the influence of the poison, nor prevent its entrance
in considerable quantities into his system; this is often caused
by the fact that the effect of the poison is so rapid that he is
often suddenly deprived of power to move or of consciousness,
and remains then exposed to the action of the poison until help
comes. Such accidents are mostly caused by poisonous gases.
Occasionally also considerable quantities of poison enter quite
unnoticed into the body, such as odourless poisonous gases in
breathing, or poisonous liquids through the skin. In chronic
industrial poisoning unsuspected accumulation of poison
takes place, until symptoms of illness ultimately reveal
themselves; as the first stages of poisoning are not recognised
in time by the person affected, he continues exposed to the
influence of the poison for weeks, months, even years, until the
chronic effect has reached its full development and becomes
obvious. Such insidious industrial poisoning arises through
the continual absorption into the lungs or stomach of small
quantities of poisonous dust, gases, and vapours, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
constant or frequent work in an atmosphere containing
such gases; poisonous liquids also, by soiling hands and
food, or by penetrating the skin, can produce slow industrial
poisoning.</p>

<p>Industrial poisoning which in respect of its duration
stands midway between acute and chronic is called sub-acute
poisoning. This usually means that more frequent absorption
of greater quantities of poison has taken place, though not in
doses large enough to produce an immediately acute effect.
This is important legally because industrial poisonings caused
through the sudden absorption of poison in sufficient quantity
to act immediately or to bring about subsequent symptoms
of poisoning, are reckoned as accidents. Thus acute and
many sub-acute industrial poisonings are accounted accidents.
Chronic industrial poisonings, acquired gradually, count as
illnesses. But as in certain cases it cannot be decided whether
sudden or gradual absorption of the industrial poison is in
question, this distinction is an unnatural one. It is also unnatural
in the legal sense, for there is often no material reason
for regarding as legally distinct cases of chronic and acute
industrial poisoning. To this we shall refer later in discussing
the question of insurance against industrial poisoning.</p>

<p>We have from the outset assumed that the effect of the
poison depends not only on the nature of the poison itself,
but also on that of the organism, considered both quantitatively
and qualitatively.</p>

<p>Significant in a quantitative respect is the body weight of
the organism, and the fatal dose of the poison must be ascertained
and stated in connection with the body weight, calculated
as a rule per kilo of the live weight.</p>

<p>The qualitative point of view must reckon with the differing
susceptibility of organisms for poison. This varying susceptibility
to the action of poison, the causes of which are very
obscure, is called disposition.</p>

<p>Different species (of animals and men) exhibit often very
different degrees of susceptibility towards one and the same
poison; the differences in this respect are often very considerable,
and one cannot simply transfer the experience experimentally
gained from one species of animal to man or another
species of animal, without further experiment. Besides disposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
sex, and still more age, often determine within the
same species marked difference of susceptibility to a poison.
Further, there is an individual disposition due to qualities
peculiar to the individual, which makes some persons more
than usually immune and others specially susceptible. Individuals
weakened by illness are particularly susceptible to
poisoning. Two diseases, in especial, favour the operation
of poison, influencing disastrously the capacity for assimilating
food, and reducing the general resisting power of the body;
of these tuberculosis stands first.</p>

<p>Individual disposition plays in industrial poisoning a part
which must not be under-estimated; it determines the possibility
of acclimatisation to a poison; some individuals capable
of resistance habituate themselves—often comparatively easily—to
a poison, and become, up to a certain limit, immune
against it, that is, they can tolerate a quantity which would
be injurious to others not so accustomed. With other individuals,
however, the opposite effect is apparent. Repeated
exposure to the action of the poison leads to an increased
susceptibility, so that acclimatisation is not possible. Innate
hyper-sensitiveness of the individual towards a poison is
called idiosyncrasy. Frequently, for example, this quality
shows itself as hyper-sensitiveness of the skin towards the
harmful action of certain poisons. A marked lowering in the
sensitiveness, innate or acquired, of the organism towards a
poison is called immunity.</p>

<p>The possibility of the absorption and action of a poison
presupposes—speaking generally—its solubility, and indeed
its solubility in the body juices.</p>

<p>In general, poison can be absorbed at very different points
of the body; so far as industrial poisons are concerned, these
are the mucous membrane of the respiratory passages, the
mucous membrane of the digestive tract, and the skin, intact
or broken. The rapidity of absorption depends on the nature
of the poison, of the individual, and the channel of absorption.
Of industrial poisons gases are relatively the most quickly
absorbed; sometimes indeed so swiftly that the effect follows
almost immediately.</p>

<p>Elimination of industrial poisons is effected principally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
by the kidneys, the intestinal canal, the respiratory organs,
and, more rarely, the skin. Rapidity of elimination also
depends on the nature of the poison and of the person
poisoned.</p>

<p>If elimination is insufficient, or absorption takes place more
quickly than excretion, the poison accumulates in the body,
and has a cumulative effect which in chronic industrial poisonings
plays a very important rôle. Under certain circumstances
poisons are not thrown off, but stored up—fixed—in
the body.</p>

<p>The poison absorbed in the body can act unchanged from
the place where it is stored. A number of poisons, however,
undergo in the organism chemical change through which the
action of the poison is partly lessened, rarely increased. Among
such changes and weakening of the poison are: oxidation, as,
for example, of organic poisons into their final products
(carbonic acid, water, &amp;c.), oxidation of benzene into phenol,
oxidation of sulphur dioxide into sulphuric acid, &amp;c.; reduction
in the case of metals, peroxides, &amp;c.; neutralisation of
acids by alkaline juices; chemical union (for instance, of aromatic
compounds with sulphuric acid). The splitting up of
albuminous bodies is not of importance in regard to industrial
poisons.</p>

<h4>GENERAL REMARKS ON THE TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL
POISONINGS</h4>

<p>Although in industrial poisoning the importance of treatment
is small in comparison with that of preventive measures,
in discussing particular forms of poisoning, full weight must
be given to it; and in order to avoid repetition, certain points
will be brought forward here.</p>

<p>Of the treatment of chronic industrial poisonings not
much in general can be said; unfortunately, special treatment
has often little chance. It will usually be of advantage
to maintain the activity of the excretory organs. So far as
there is question of poisons affecting metabolism and injuriously
influencing the general state of nutrition, treatment aiming at
improving the general health and strength offers hope of
success. For nervous symptoms, especially paralysis, disturbance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in sensation, &amp;c., treatment generally suitable to nervous
diseases can be tried (electro-therapeutics, baths, &amp;c.). In
treatment of acute industrial poisonings, which often demand
the prompt intervention of laymen, ‘first aid’ is more
hopeful.</p>

<p>The most important general rules of treatment arise in
reference to irritant poisons which produce ulceration of the
skin, and further in regard to those poisons which cause
unconsciousness, especially blood poisons.</p>

<p>When an irritant poison is acting on the skin, the first
object to be aimed at is naturally the immediate removal
of the cause of corrosion by water, or, better still, neutralisation
by an alkaline solution (for example, soda solution) in
the case of corrosive acids, and weak acids (organic acids, acetic
acid, citric acid) in the case of caustic action by alkalis. Such
remedies must be at hand in factories as part of the equipment
for first aid, where irritant poisonings can occur.</p>

<p>In those industrial poisonings which result in loss of consciousness,
arrest of respiration and suffocation, attempts at
resuscitation should at once be made. In these attempts
at resuscitation, <i>artificial respiration</i> is of the greatest importance;
of course the sufferer must first be withdrawn from the
influence of the poison, i.e. be brought into fresh air. Great
care must be taken, especially where it is necessary to enter
places filled with a poisonous atmosphere, to prevent the
rescuers, as is often the case, themselves falling victims to the
influence of the poison. They should be provided with suitable
smoke helmets or breathing apparatus.</p>

<p>We will not describe the methods of resuscitation and
artificial respiration universally enjoined; they can be found
in every first-aid handbook.</p>

<p>Emphasis is laid on the great importance of <i>treatment by
oxygen</i> in cases of industrial poisoning through gaseous blood
poisons, as this treatment is attended with good results.
Apparatus for the administration of oxygen should be kept
wherever there exists the possibility of such poisoning,
especially in mines, smelting works, chemical factories, and
chemical laboratories.</p>

<p>Oxygen treatment rests on the fact that by raising the
pressure of the oxygen from 113 mm., as it is generally in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
ordinary air, to 675 mm., which is reached in presence of pure
oxygen, the quantity of oxygen absorbed in the blood rises
from 0·3 to 1·8 per 100 c.c. Further, the saturation of the
hæmoglobin, the colouring matter of the blood, undergoes an
increase of 2·4 per cent. This increase of oxygen in the blood
can save life in cases where through poisoning a deficiency of
oxygen has resulted.</p>

<p>The introduction of oxygen is done by special apparatus
which acts essentially on
the principle that during
inhalation oxygen is pressed
into the lungs which are
below normal physiological
pressure, while exhalation is
effected by a deflating
arrangement when the
poisoned individual no longer
breathes of his own accord.
When natural breathing
begins, the introduction of
oxygen without special apparatus
generally suffices.</p>

<p>Dräger’s <i>oxygen apparatus</i>
(<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>) consists of a small
oxygen cylinder provided
with a closing valve, a small
manometer, a so-called
‘automatic’ reducing valve
with an arrangement for
opening and closing the
oxygen supply, a bag to act as a receiver or economiser, a
breathing mask, and a metal tube connecting the breathing
mask with the other parts of the apparatus. The oxygen
cylinder, when filled, contains about 180 litres of oxygen, and
the manometer allows the manipulator to control at any time
whatever oxygen it still contains. The automatic arrangement
not only reduces the pressure but at the same time
controls the supply of oxygen. This dose is fixed at three
litres of oxygen per minute, so that the apparatus with the
same oxygen cylinder will last for sixty minutes. The oxygen
is not inhaled pure, but is mixed with atmospheric air
according to need, and in order to make this possible the
breathing mask is provided with a small hole through which
atmospheric air finds entrance.</p>

<p>As the oxygen flows continuously from the cylinder waste

during exhalation, the inflowing oxygen accumulates, to be
absorbed again in inhalation. A small relief valve in the

exhaled air.</p>

<p>Another oxygen inhaling apparatus for resuscitating purposes,
that of Siebe, Gorman &amp; Co., is illustrated in figs. <a href="#fig31">31</a>
and <a href="#fig32">32</a>.</p>

<p>Dräger also constructs an apparatus called the ‘Pulmotor’
which simultaneously accomplishes the introduction of oxygen
and artificial respiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Inflation and deflation are effected by an injector driven by
compressed oxygen; this alternately drives fresh air enriched
with oxygen into the lungs and then by suction empties them
again. While with the mechanical appliances of resuscitation
belonging to older systems the hand of the helper regulated the
rate of breathing, in the case of the Pulmotor the lungs,
according to their size, automatically fix the rate of breathing;
as soon as the lungs are filled the apparatus of its own accord
marks the moment for ‘deflation,’ and as soon as they are
emptied of ‘inflation.’ This automatic reversal is effected by
a little bellows which is connected with the air tubes. During
inflation the same pressure is exerted in the bellows as in the
lungs. As soon as the lungs are filled, the pressure in the
bellows increases and it expands, its forward movement causing
the reversal to deflation. When the lungs are emptied the
bellows contracts, and through this contraction results the
reversal to inflation.</p>

<p>If, in an exceptional case, the breathing for some reason
does not act automatically, the hand of the helper can
manipulate it by means of a backward and forward movement
of a lever. According to choice, either a nose-mask or a mask
covering both mouth and nose can be worn.</p>

<p>Combined with the regular apparatus for resuscitation is an
ordinary apparatus for the inhalation of oxygen; by the simple
altering of a lever, either the one or the other can be employed.</p>

<h3 id="II_INDUSTRIAL_POISONING_IN_PARTICULAR_INDUSTRIES">II. INDUSTRIAL POISONING IN PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES</h3>

<p>After the foregoing general remarks we may now consider
various points of view in regard to classification of industrial
poisonings into groups:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Toxicological, based on the action of the poisons.</p>

poisons.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(4) Classification according to the source of the poisoning
and therefore according to industry, upon which
Part I is mainly based.</p>

</div>

<p>In this section (Part II) a system is adopted which takes
into consideration as far as possible all the principles of
division mentioned above, in order to classify industrial
poisonous substances in such a manner that general practical
conclusions can be clearly drawn, and supervision rendered
easy.</p>

<h4><i>GROUP: MINERAL ACIDS, HALOGENS, INORGANIC
HALOGEN COMPOUNDS, ALKALIS</i></h4>

<p>Common to this group is a strong corrosive and irritant
effect, varying however in degree; as gases this group corrode
or inflame the mucous membrane of the respiratory passages,
and in liquid form or in solution, the skin.</p>

<p>Besides this superficial effect single members of this group,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
especially those containing nitrogen, produce a remote effect
upon the blood.</p>

<p>After absorption of the acids a decrease in the alkalinity
of the blood can take place and in its power to take up
carbonic acid, thus vitally affecting the interchange of
gases in the body, and producing symptoms of tissue
suffocation.</p>

<p>As regards treatment in the case of acids and alkalis,
neutralisation has been already mentioned; further, oxygen
treatment may be recommended in cases where the blood has
been injuriously affected. In cases of poisoning through
breathing in acid vapours, inhalation of extremely rarefied
vapour of ammonia or of a spray of soda solution (about
1 per cent.) is advisable.</p>

<h5>MINERAL ACIDS</h5>

<p><b>Hydrochloric Acid</b> (HCl) is a colourless, pungently smelling
gas which gives off strong white fumes. Experiments on
animals, carefully carried out by Leymann, produced the
following symptoms.</p>

<p>Even in a concentration of 2-5 per thousand clouding of
the cornea ensues, and after about an hour inflammation of
the conjunctiva, violent running from every exposed mucous
membrane with marked reddening, and frequently inflammation
(necrosis) of the septum of the nose; the lungs are distended
with blood, here and there hæmorrhages occur in the
respiratory and also in the digestive tracts. The animal dies
of œdema (swelling) of the lungs and hæmorrhage into the
lungs if exposed long enough to the action of HCl, even
though (according to Lehmann) there may not be accumulation
of HCl in the blood; the chief effect is the irritant
one; 1·5-5 per thousand parts HCl in the air suffices, after
three or four hours’ exposure, to affect smaller animals
(rabbits) so much that they die during the experiment or
shortly after it. Man can tolerate an atmosphere containing
0·1 to 0·2 per thousand HCl; a somewhat greater proportion
of HCl produces bronchial catarrh, cough, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The solution of hydrochloric acid in water is about 40 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
cent. Simply wetting the skin with concentrated solution of
hydrochloric acid does not generally have an irritant effect
unless persisted in for some time; the action of the acid, when
continued, has a marked effect upon the mucous membranes
and upon the eyes.</p>

<p>The same treatment already recommended in the introductory
remarks on poisoning by inhalation of acid fumes in
general applies.</p>

<p><b>Hydrofluoric Acid</b> (HFl), a pungently smelling, colourless
gas, causes even in weak solutions (0·02 per cent.) irritant
symptoms (catarrh of the mucous membrane of the respiratory
organs, lachrymation, &amp;c.). Stronger solutions set up
obstinate ulcers, difficult to heal, in the mucous membrane
and the skin.</p>

<p><b>Silico-fluoric Acid</b> (H₂SiFl₆) produces an analogous though
somewhat less marked corrosive action.</p>

<p>As regards treatment the reader is again referred to the
introductory sentences on this group.</p>

<p><b>Sulphur Dioxide</b> (SO₂) is a colourless, pungently smelling
gas which, acting in low concentration or for a short period,
causes cough and irritation of the mucous membrane of the
respiratory passages and of the eyes; acting for a longer
period, it sets up inflammation of the mucous membrane,
bronchial catarrh, expectoration of blood, and inflammation
of the lungs.</p>

<p>As Ogata and Lehmann have proved by experiments—some
of them made on man—a proportion of 0·03-0·04 per thousand
of sulphur dioxide in the air has a serious effect on a person
unaccustomed to it, while workmen used to this gas can
tolerate it easily.</p>

<p>As sulphur dioxide probably does not affect the blood,
treatment by oxygen inhalation is useless. Otherwise the
treatment spoken of as applying to acid poisonings in general
holds good.</p>

<p><b>Sulphuric Acid</b> (H₂SO₄). Concentrated sulphuric acid occasionally
splashes into the eye or wets the skin, causing severe
irritation and corrosion, unless the liquid is quickly washed
off or neutralised. If the action of the acid persists, the corrosive
effect becomes deepseated and leads to disfiguring scars.</p>

<p><b>Nitrous Fumes, Nitric Acid.</b>—Nitric oxide (NO) oxidises in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
air with formation of red fumes composed of nitrogen trioxide
(N₂O₃) and nitrogen peroxide (NO₂). These oxides are contained
in the gases evolved from fuming nitric acid and where nitric
acid acts upon metals, organic substances, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Industrial poisoning by nitrous fumes is dangerous; unfortunately
it frequently occurs and often runs a severe, even
fatal, course; sometimes numerous workers are poisoned
simultaneously. The main reason why nitrous fumes are so
dangerous is because their effect, like that of most other
irritant gases, is not shown at once in symptoms of irritation,
such as cough, cramp of the glottis, &amp;c., which would at
least serve as a warning to the affected person; on the contrary,
generally no effect at all is felt at first, especially if the
fumes are not very concentrated. Symptoms of irritation
usually appear only after some hours’ stay in the poisonous
atmosphere. By this time a relatively large quantity of the
poisonous gas has been absorbed, and the remote effect on the
blood induced.</p>

<p>The first symptoms of irritation (cough, difficulty of
breathing, nausea, &amp;c.) generally disappear when the affected
person leaves the charged atmosphere, and he then often
passes several hours without symptoms, relatively well. Later
severe symptoms supervene—often rather suddenly—difficulty
of breathing, fits of suffocation, cyanosis, and copious frothy
blood-stained expectoration with symptoms of inflammation
of the bronchial tubes and lungs. These attacks may last a
longer or shorter time, and in severe cases can lead to death;
slight cases end in recovery, without any sequelæ.</p>

<p>In poisoning by nitrous acid fumes, oxygen inhalation,
if applied in time, undoubtedly holds out hope of success,
and should always be tried. Chloroform has been repeatedly
recommended as a remedy. Probably its inhalation produces
no actual curative effect, but only an abatement of the
symptoms through the narcosis induced.</p>

<p>Nitric acid (HNO₃) in solution has an irritant corroding
action if, when concentrated, it comes into contact with the
skin or mucous membrane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h5>THE HALOGENS (CHLORINE, BROMINE, IODINE)</h5>

<p>Chlorine (Cl) is a yellow-green, pungently smelling gas,
Bromine (Br) a fuming liquid, and Iodine (I) forms crystals
which volatilise slightly at ordinary temperatures.</p>

<p>According to Lehmann’s experiments on animals the effect
of chlorine gas and bromine fumes is completely similar. Lehmann
and Binz assume that chlorine has a twofold effect:
(1) narcotic, paralysing the outer membrane of the brain, and
(2) the well-known irritant action upon the mucous membrane,
producing a general catarrh of the air passages, and inflammation
of the lungs; it is, however, only the latter which causes
menace to life. Other writers do not mention the narcotic
effect upon the brain and assume that the halogens when
brought into contact with the mucous membrane are quickly
converted into halogen hydrides, and, as such, produce a corrosive
effect. According to Lehmann, even 0·01 per thousand Cl
or Br in the air is injurious, even 0·1 per thousand produces
ulceration of the mucous membrane, and one or two hours’ exposure
to the poison endangers life. Lehmann has further tested
(on dogs) acclimatisation to chlorine, and finds that after a
month the power of resistance to chlorine appears to be increased
about ten times. In a further series of experiments the same
author has proved that even the smallest quantities of chlorine
present in the atmosphere are completely absorbed in breathing.</p>

<p>Continued or frequent action of chlorine upon the organism
produces symptoms which have been described as chronic
chlorine poisoning—such as anæmia and indigestion, in
addition to catarrhal and nervous symptoms. Further, in
factories where chlorine is produced by the electrolytic process,
workers were found to be suffering from the so-called chlorine
rash (first observed by Herxheimer). This skin disease consists
in an inflammation of the glands of the skin, with occasional
development of ulcers and scars. Severe cases are accompanied
by digestive disturbance. Bettmann, Lehmann, and
others maintain that it is not caused by chlorine alone,
but by chlorinated tar products, which are formed in the
production of chlorine and hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>In acute cases of chlorine poisoning oxygen treatment should
be tried, but in any case the patient should have free access to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
pure air. Approved remedies are inhalation of soda spray or
very dilute ammonia, or of a vapourised solution of sodium
hypochlorite. If the patient is in great pain, he may be
allowed to inhale cocaine solution (0·2 per cent.).</p>

<p>The administration of arsenic (solutio arsenicalis) is recommended,
especially in cases of acne. In general the usual
treatment for diseases of the skin is followed; salicylic
acid lotions, sulphur baths, and sulphur ointments may be
made use of.</p>

<p><b>Chlorides.</b>—<i>Chlorides of Phosphorus</i>, <i>Phosphorus-trichloride</i>
(PCl₃), and <i>Phosphorus oxychloride</i> (POCl₃), are strong-smelling
liquids, fuming in the air, and when brought
into contact with water decomposing into phosphorous
acid and hydrochloric acid. These halogen compounds of
phosphorus have a violently irritant action upon the respiratory
organs and the eyes, in that they decompose on the mucous
membrane into hydrochloric acid and an oxyacid of phosphorus.
Inhalation of the fumes of these compounds causes
cough, difficulty of breathing, inflammation of the respiratory
passages, and blood-stained expectoration.</p>

<p>Treatment is similar to that for acid poisoning in general
and hydrochloric acid in particular.</p>

<p>Similar to that of the chlorides of phosphorus is the action
of <i>chlorides of sulphur</i>, of which <i>sulphur monochloride</i> (S₂Cl)₂
is of industrial hygienic importance as it is employed in the
vulcanising of indiarubber. It is a brown, oily, fuming liquid,
which, mixed with water or even in damp air, decomposes into
sulphur dioxide and hydrochloric acid. The fumes of sulphur
monochloride have therefore a marked irritant effect, like
that of hydrochloric acid and sulphur dioxide. The action of
sulphur chloride was thoroughly studied by Lehmann. Industrial
poisoning by sulphur chloride is mentioned by Leymann
and also in the reports of the Prussian factory inspectors for
1897. The latter case ended fatally owing to the ignorance of
the would-be rescuers: a workman had spilt trichloride of
phosphorus upon his clothes, and the by-standers, not knowing
its dangerous action when combined with water, poured water
on him.</p>

<p>Treatment is similar to that of poisoning from hydrochloric
acid or sulphur dioxide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chloride of zinc</i> (zinc chloride, ZnCl₂) likewise has corroding
and irritant action upon the mucous membrane of the
respiratory organs.</p>

<h5>AMMONIA</h5>

<p>Ammonia (NH₃) is a colourless, pungent-smelling gas which
dissolves to the extent of about 33 per cent. in water. Inhaled,
it first produces violent reflex coughing, then irritation
and corrosion of the mucous membrane of the respiratory
organs, and finally death through suffocation (spasm of the
glottis) if exposure to its action has lasted a sufficiently long
time. Microscopic sections exhibit a diphtheritic appearance
of the mucous membrane, and inflammation of the lungs. The
effects upon the central nervous system (irritation of the
medulla and spinal cord) which are peculiar to ammonia
compounds need not be considered, as the corrosion of the
respiratory passage is sufficient alone to cause death. When
the action of the gas is less intense, the patient rallies from the
first stage, but often severe symptoms come on later affecting
the lungs.</p>

<p>Lehmann in experiments upon himself could tolerate as
much as 0·33 per thousand NH₃ for thirty minutes; he found
in gas works (with fairly marked odour) hardly more than
0·1 per thousand NH₃ in the atmosphere, and considers 0·5
per thousand distinct evidence of excess. He found that he
could produce in dogs acclimatisation up to 1·0 per thousand
NH₃ (five times as much as could at first be borne). About 88
per cent. of the ammonia contained in the air is absorbed
in breathing; ammonia is said to exercise also a reducing
action upon the oxygen of the blood (oxyhæmoglobin).</p>

<p>Chronic poisoning by ammonia can hardly be said to occur.
In those who clean out sewers and drains, the inflammation
of the eyes and digestive disturbance attributed partly to
ammonia are probably due more to the action of sulphur
compounds—ammonium sulphide and sulphuretted hydrogen.
Irritation due to solution of ammonia does not come into
account in industrial employment.</p>

<p>As regards treatment, fresh air or administration of oxygen
is most likely to be successful. Inhalation also of very dilute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
acetic acid vapour, steam, or spray of sodium carbonate is
advocated.</p>

<h5>ALKALIS</h5>

<p>The alkaline hydroxides (potassium and sodium hydroxide,
KOH, NaOH) have an albumen-dissolving and therefore
caustic effect. Industrially it occurs in the caustic action of
concentrated (often hot) lyes upon the skin or upon the eye—through
splashing. Quicklime (CaO) has also a caustic
action, producing inflammation of the skin or eyes (especially
in those engaged in the preparation of mortar).</p>

<p>Under this head comes also the effect upon the respiratory
passages—described by several authors—caused in the production
of artificial manure discussed at length in Part I.</p>

<p>As regards treatment of the irritant effect of alkalis, what
has been said as to corrosives in general applies here (rinsing
with water or weak organic acids), and in inflammation of the
eye caused by lime a drop of castor oil is recommended.</p>

<h4><i>GROUP: METALS AND METAL-COMPOUNDS</i></h4>

<p>The various substances of this group differ markedly
in their action. Under this heading come principally
chronic metal poisonings, characterised by a general, often
very intense, disturbance of nutrition, which justifies their
delineation as ‘metabolic poisons’; among these poisons also
are included certain others which produce chronic poisoning
accompanied by severe disturbance of the peripheral and
central nervous system.</p>

<p>The corrosive action common to the metal oxides (when
acting in a concentrated condition), attributable to the
formation of insoluble albuminates, need not, in industrial
poisoning, be taken so much into account. The corrosive
effect is characteristic only of the compounds, especially of
the acid salts of chromium, which, as an acid-forming element,
may be classed in the preceding group. Disturbance of health
in workmen handling nickel compounds are also ascribed to
the corrosive action of these substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<h5>LEAD, LEAD COMPOUNDS</h5>

<p>Lead poisoning is the most frequent and important chronic
industrial poisoning; the symptoms are very varied and
associated with the most different groups of organs. We shall
describe the typical course of a case of industrial lead poisoning,
laying stress, however, on the fact that numerous cases
follow an irregular course, in that special symptoms or complications
of symptoms are in some especially accentuated, while
in others they become less marked or are absent altogether.</p>

<p>A premonitory indication of chronic lead poisoning is a
blue line on the gum, indicated by a slate gray or bluish black
edging to the teeth, the appearance of which is usually accompanied
by an unpleasant sweetish taste in the mouth. The
cause of this blue line was for some time disputed. It is
obviously due to the formation and deposit of sulphide of lead
through the action of sulphuretted hydrogen arising from
decomposition in the mouth cavity. At the same time a
general feeling of malaise and weakness often comes on,
occasionally accompanied by tremor of the muscles and
disinclination for food, at which stage the sufferer consults the
doctor. Frequently he complains also of pains in the stomach,
not difficult to distinguish from the lead colic to be described
later. Usually the patient already exhibits at this stage
general emaciation and marked pallor.</p>

<p>The blue line was formerly considered a characteristic early
indication of lead poisoning; but it has now been proved that
occasionally it is absent even in severe attacks. But although
the blue line may fail as an ‘initial symptom,’ it will nevertheless
be a valuable aid to the practitioner in the recognition
of lead poisoning. It is worth while to mention the fact that
other metallic poisons produce a very similar ‘line,’ especially
mercury, also iron and silver (as in the case of argyria); it has
been stated that the blue line can be simulated by particles
of charcoal on the gum. The pallor of the patient at the commencement
of lead poisoning drew attention to the condition
of the blood. The diminution in the amount of hæmoglobin
often met with, which under certain circumstances is accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
by diminution of the red blood cells, offers nothing
characteristic. On the other hand, structural changes in the
red blood cells—presence of basophil granules in them—are
asserted by a number of writers to be characteristic of the first
stages of lead poisoning. The basophil granules are believed
to be due to regenerative changes in the nucleus. But these
changes are also found in pernicious anæmia, cancer, leucæmia,
anæmia, tuberculosis, &amp;c.; also in a number of poisonings such
as phenylhydrazine, dinitrobenzene, corrosive sublimate, and
others; they are therefore the less characteristic of chronic
lead poisoning, as occasionally they cannot be found in actual
lead poisoning, a point upon which I have convinced myself
in the case both of men and animals. Still, the appearance of
much basophilia in the red blood cells is a valuable aid to
diagnosis, especially as the method of staining to demonstrate
them is simple.</p>

<p>Other anomalies of the blood observed in lead poisoning
may here be mentioned. Glibert found a striking diminution
in the elasticity of the red blood corpuscles, and experiments
I have made point to the fact that the power of resistance
of the red blood corpuscles to chemically acting hæmolytic
agents, such as decinormal soda solution, is considerably
reduced.</p>

<p>The pulse is generally hard and of high tension, especially
during the attacks of colic. Further, cramp of the bloodvessels
(also in the retinal arteries) has been observed. To
these functional disturbances in the circulation are added
sometimes definite changes in the vessel wall. Later,
obliterative arteritis comes on (in the brain arteries), and
arteriosclerosis.</p>

<p>The most important symptom of fully developed lead
poisoning is colic, which is usually preceded by the initial
symptoms described (especially the gastric symptoms), but not
always so, as occasionally colic sets in without any warning.
The colic pains often set in with marked vehemence. They
radiate from the navel on all sides, even through the whole
body; the abdomen is contracted and as hard as a board.
Pressure on the lower part diminishes the pain somewhat,
so that the sufferer often involuntarily lies flat on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
stomach. During the attack the pulse is often remarkably
slow. Constipation occurs, and often does not yield to purgatives.
The attacks last sometimes for hours, occasionally for
days, or the pains can (with remissions) even distress the
patient for weeks. The frequency of attacks is also very
variable. Occasionally one attack follows another, often
there are intervals of weeks, even years, according to the
severity of the poisoning and duration of exposure. If the
patient is removed from the injurious action of lead, as a rule
recovery soon ensues.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34a.</span>—Different Types of Paralysis of the Radial Nerve in Hungarian Potters
poisoned by Lead (<i>after Chyzer</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>Often with the colic, or at any rate shortly after it, appear
lead tremor and arthralgia, paroxysmal pain mostly affecting
the joints, but occasionally also the muscles and bones. They
are often the precursor of severe nervous symptoms which
affect the peripheral and central nervous system. In a lead
poisoning case running a typical course the predominant
feature is the peripheral motor paralysis of the extensors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the forearms. Next the muscles supplied by the radial and
ulnar nerves are affected. Often the progress of the paralysis
is typical; it begins with paralysis of the extensor digitorum
communis, passes on to the remaining extensors, then to the
abductor muscles of the hand; the supinator longus and triceps
escape. Sometimes the shoulder muscles are attacked;
also paralysis in the region supplied by the facial nerve and
of the lower extremities is observed. It appears plausible
that overstrain of single groups of muscles plays a decisive
part; this seems proved by the fact that paralysis first affects,
among right-handed people, the right hand (especially of
painters), but in the case of left-handed, the left hand;
and among children the lower extremities are often attacked
first. Disturbance of sight increasing to amaurosis is often
an indication of severe brain symptoms. The view of some
writers that the cause of the sight disturbance lies in vasomotor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
influences (cramp of the bloodvessels) is very probable,
and supports the view that the brain symptoms are entirely
due to diseases of the arteries (arteritis). These symptoms
are distinguished by the collective name of saturnine
encephalopathy; they include apoplexy, hemiplegia, epilepsy,
delirium, and mania. The brain symptoms may cause death.</p>

<p>As later symptoms of lead poisoning may be mentioned
lead gout and kidney disease (lead nephritis). The genesis of
both these diseases is much disputed. It seems to be proved
that the gout is true gout (with presence of tophi) and that the
contracted kidney is indistinguishable from ordinary chronic
Bright’s disease.</p>

<p>The kidney symptoms suggest that a regular excretion of
lead through the urine takes place which, if it were a fact,
would have been an important aid to diagnosis. But often
analysis of urine for presence of lead is negative. Excretion of
lead by the skin is scarcely to be credited, although occasionally
affirmed. Elimination of lead is effected mainly through
the intestines (probably for the most part as sulphide of
lead).</p>

<p>All lead compounds more or less are to be regarded as poisonous,
although the intensity of the action depends on the amount
absorbed. For this its solubility in water or in weak acids
(hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice) is the simplest test.
According to this acetate of lead, lead chloride, carbonate
of lead (white lead), oxide of lead (lead dross), minium
(red oxide of lead) are relatively the most poisonous. Lead
sulphate and lead iodide are to be regarded as relatively less
poisonous, although by no means innocuous. The least
poisonous, if not altogether innocuous, is sulphide of lead,
because it is an insoluble lead compound.</p>

<p>Treatment of lead poisoning ought to aim first and foremost
at the elimination of lead from the body. But unfortunately
such attempts have had little success. Treatment of symptoms
is all that for the most part is possible. Administration of
iodide of potassium to assist the excretion of lead has not been
found the success which many anticipated. This remedy
however, can be tried; better results are to be expected
from careful regulation of the bowels by means of purgatives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
During colic administration of opium or morphia may be
advisable to relieve pain and overcome the probable cramp
of the intestinal muscles. The cautious administration of
atropine (occasionally with cocaine) also serves the same
purpose. Hot compresses and mustard plasters may be
applied, and liquid diet should be given. Lead cachexia
must be treated by strengthening diet. Electrical treatment
for lead paralysis is advocated. From baths (sulphur baths)
nothing more is to be expected than a bracing effect—elimination
of lead through increased diaphoresis is hardly to be
hoped for.</p>

<h5>ZINC (ZINC ALLOYS)</h5>

<p>Zinc (Zn) melts at 412° C. and distills at about 900° C.;
exposed to the air it burns, when heated, into zinc oxide.
Older writers, when investigating gastric and intestinal diseases
and affections of the nervous system observed in zinc smelters,
regarded them as the result of chronic zinc poisoning; but it
may now be accepted as certain that these symptoms are due
to the lead always present in the zinc.</p>

<p>On the other hand so-called <i>brass-founders’ ague</i> may be
regarded as a form of acute industrial zinc poisoning. Brass-founders’
ague occurs exclusively in brass casters, and not in
zinc workers. Sigel and Lehmann have shown that founders’
ague is also caused by pure zinc if this is heated so strongly
that it burns.</p>

<p>Premonitory symptoms often occur before the onset of
the disease; usually they appear early, soon after casting
has begun. The workman has general malaise accompanied
by slight cough, nausea, throat irritation, &amp;c., but these
symptoms mostly disappear, returning again after a few hours
with renewed violence, often in the evening before going to
bed. Frequently, trembling sets in rather suddenly, often
accompanied by headache, nausea, and muscular pains, and
soon develops into a pronounced shivering fit, lasting
generally about a quarter of an hour, but in severe cases
for several hours (with intervals). At the same time
the breathing is hurried and the heart’s action quickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
(asthma and palpitation). Often the temperature rises as
high as 104° F. The attack ends with profuse perspiration,
and the patient sinks exhausted to sleep, awaking in the
morning generally quite restored or with but slight signs of
fatigue; only rarely is he unable to resume work.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that some workmen are extraordinarily
susceptible to brass-founders’ ague, and are attacked again
and again, while others remain completely immune, so that
idiosyncrasy and immunity both play a part. Workmen
who are susceptible to the disease, yet without marked disposition
(idiosyncrasy) towards it, can become acclimatised
to the poison. Lehmann has succeeded in artificially producing
an attack in a brass-caster who was highly susceptible.
The symptoms in him were the result of work with pure zinc
in a burning condition. The proof, therefore, is clear that
brass-founders’ ague is due to zinc, and not, as some authors
have supposed, to copper or the simultaneous action of both
metals. The symptoms are produced through inhalation of
zinc oxide, not zinc fumes.</p>

<p>Lehmann conjectures that brass-founders’ ague may be a
secondary fever due to absorption into the system of the remains
of cells in the respiratory tract that have been killed by the
action of the zinc.</p>

<p>The treatment can only be symptomatic; as the attack
is so transient, medical attendance is hardly necessary.</p>

<h5>MERCURY, MERCURY COMPOUNDS</h5>

<p>Mercury (Hg), on account of its volatility, is classed
among industrial poisons. Although boiling at 360° C. it is
volatile even at ordinary temperature. Industrial mercurial
poisoning is caused by the frequent inhalation of small quantities
of vapour, sometimes, but more rarely, of dust containing
mercury, and assumes usually a chronic form.</p>

<p>Industrial mercurial poisoning often begins with inflammation
of the mucous membrane of the mouth and gums.
There is increased flow of saliva, a disagreeable metallic
taste in the mouth, and foul breath. This may be limited
to a simple inflammation of the gum, or go on to ulceration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
with falling out of teeth, or even to gangrene of the gum
and mucous membrane inside the mouth. Gastric attacks
also occur in the early stages; occasionally, however, they
are absent.</p>

<p>The main symptoms of chronic mercurial poisoning are
nervous and psychical derangement, to which in severe cases
are added general disturbance of digestion and loss of strength.</p>

<p>Sometimes, after repeated attacks, more or less severe,
a cachectic condition is induced, showing itself in general
emaciation, decrease of strength, atrophy of the muscles,
anæmia, and disturbed digestion, which—often intensified
by some intercurrent disease, such as tuberculosis—lead to
death. Slight cases of mercurialism recover, leaving no evil
results, if the patient is removed in time from the influence
of the poison.</p>

<p>The treatment of chronic mercury poisoning is symptomatic.
To allay the inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
mouth the patient should use a mouth wash of potassium
chlorate and peroxide of hydrogen; the general condition
should be raised by strengthening, unstimulating food; for
the nervous symptoms baths and electricity should be tried;
and for very marked erythism and tremor recourse to narcotics
may be necessary.</p>

<p>Industrial mercurial poisoning is produced not only by
metallic mercury but also by many compounds, of which
industrially the oxides are the most important. Nitrate of
mercury (Hg₂(NO₃)₂) comes into account in the treatment of
fur. Mercury cyanide (HgCy₂) deserves mention, as small
quantities cause mercurial and large quantities cyanogen
poisoning.</p>

<h5>MANGANESE, MANGANESE COMPOUNDS</h5>

<p>Manganese (Mn) or manganese compounds are used
industrially in fine powder; continuous absorption of dust
containing manganese produces chronic manganese poisoning.
Instances of such poisoning are not very numerous; altogether
about twenty cases have been described. Recent publications
agree in asserting that only the dust rich in manganese
protoxide is dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Industrial manganese poisoning runs its course extraordinarily
slowly, and resembles chronic poisoning by other
heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, in that nervous and
psychical symptoms, rather than digestive, are prominent.
Sometimes—but not always—the disease is introduced or
accompanied by psychical symptoms, both of excitement and
depression (hilarity, laughing, or depression and weeping).
In the course of the disease nervous disturbances arise, deafness,
tingling, paralysis and paræsthesia, in the arms and legs,
giddiness, difficulty of walking, tremor, increased knee-jerks
and difficulty in speech. Often at the same time swelling of
the lower extremities (œdema) and loss of strength (cachexia,
marasmus) come on. Slight cases make a good recovery.
An interesting case of illness is described by Jaksch as manganophobia,
in which the symptoms were simulated, and
were brought on solely by the fear of manganese poisoning.</p>

<p>As regards treatment, electricity, massage, and baths are
advocated to allay the nervous symptoms, as in the case of
chronic metal poisoning and suitable strengthening food.</p>

<h5>CHROMIUM, CHROME COMPOUNDS</h5>

<p>Chromium trioxide (CrO₃) dissolves in water, forming
chromic acid (H₂CrO₄); of the salts of chromic acid the
neutral and acid alkaline salts concern our inquiry. These
are normal and acid sodium or potassium chromate (K₂CrO₄
and K₂Cr₂O₇). Chromate of lead (PbCrO₄) can cause lead
poisoning.</p>

<p>Poisoning can be produced by dust and by alkaline
chromates, the latter, when hot, giving off steam which, as
has been proved, contains excessively fine chrome particles.
Chrome compounds attack especially the surface of the body,
the skin and the mucous membrane.</p>

<p>The bichromate and chromate dust produce ulcers where
slight injuries to the skin already exist. The ulcers develop
slowly, and have a smooth, heaped-up, undermined edge;
deep-seated, they can even pierce to the bone; they heal with
great difficulty. Naturally they occur most frequently on the
uncovered parts of the body, especially on the arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
hands. Characteristic also is an analogous ulceration attacking
the mucous membrane of the nose, from which hardly any
chrome worker (especially if brought into contact with
chromate dust) is free. Perforation and destruction of the
cartilaginous septum of the nose is very common. Ulcers
on the mucous membrane at the entrance of the throat (on
tonsils and palate or in the larynx) have been occasionally
observed.</p>

<p>Absorption of small quantities of chrome compounds into
the body are said to cause disturbances of digestion of an
inflammatory character, and especially inflammation of the
kidneys.</p>

<p>The treatment of chrome ulcers is similar to that of other
chronic ulcers. An antidote for industrial chrome poisoning is
not known.</p>

<h5>OTHER METALS AND METAL COMPOUNDS</h5>

<p><b>Nickel Salts.</b>—Of late years in nickel-plating establishments
an eczematous inflammation of the skin has been described
affecting first of all the hands, and occasionally spreading over
the arms and even the whole body. The skin becomes inflamed,
and vesicles appear on the affected part. Some persons are
extraordinarily susceptible to this disease, others only become
so after having worked for years quite unaffected, and are then
obliged to give up their occupation. Probably the action of
nickel salts (especially nickel sulphate) used in electrolytic baths
causes the disease. But it was in fact traced by several writers
to contact with benzene, petroleum, and lime by the workmen.
The simultaneous action of these substances upon the skin
would no doubt encourage its appearance. The application
to the skin of vaseline or cream is recommended. Careful
cleanliness and attention to the skin is on the whole by far
the most reliable protection.</p>

<p>[<b>Nickel carbonyl</b> (Ni(CO)₄).—Mond, Langer, and Quincke
in 1890 discovered that, on passing a current of carbon
monoxide over finely divided (pyrophoric) metallic nickel, a
gaseous compound of nickel and carbon monoxide was formed.
When heated to 150° C. the gas decomposes into its constituents
and metallic nickel is deposited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Nickel carbonyl is a clear, pale straw-coloured liquid,
volatilising at room temperature. It has a peculiar soot-like
smell detectable when present to the extent of about 1 vol. in
2,000,000, while the Bunsen flame becomes luminous when
nickel carbonyl is present in the air to the extent of 1 vol. in
400,000—two facts of great importance in detecting escape
of the gas in the manufacture of pure nickel by the Mond
process.</p>

<p><i>Occurrence of poisoning by nickel carbonyl.</i>—At the first
introduction of the process about 1902, before the dangerous
properties of the gas had been sufficiently recognised, some
twenty-five men were poisoned, of whom three died. Poisoning
only occurred when, as a result of the breakdown of the automatic
working of the plant, hand labour took the place of
machinery.</p>

<p>This very rare form of poisoning has been very fully investigated
by H. W. Armit (<i>Journ. of Hygiene</i>, 1907, p. 526, and
1908, p. 565). The symptoms in man, he says, were transient
headache and giddiness and at times dyspnœa, quickly passing
off on removal to fresh air. After from twelve to thirty-six
hours the dyspnœa returned, cyanosis appeared, and the
temperature began to be raised. Cough with more or less
blood-stained sputum appeared on the second day. The
pulse rate became increased, but not in proportion to the
respiratory rate. The heart remained normal. Delirium of
varying types frequently occurred. Death took place in the
fatal cases between the fourth and eleventh days. The chief
changes found post mortem were hæmorrhages in the lungs,
œdema of the lungs, and hæmorrhages in the white matter of the
brain, while some doubt exists as to whether any blood changes
were present.</p>

<p>Precisely analogous results were found in experiments on
animals (rabbits, cats, and dogs).</p>

<p>The points Armit investigated experimentally were (1) Is the
carbon monoxide of the compound wholly or partly responsible
for the symptoms, or (2), is nickel carbonyl absorbed as such,
or (3), is it the nickel of the compound which produces the
symptoms? His conclusions are that the poisonous effects
of nickel carbonyl are entirely due to the nickel of the
compound. The peculiar toxicity is due to the fact that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
being introduced in a gaseous form, the nickel is deposited
as a slightly soluble compound in a very fine state of subdivision
over the immense area of the respiratory surface.
Nickel carbonyl when mixed with air cannot be absorbed as
such by an animal as it becomes split up into the nickel containing
substance (possibly hydrated basic carbonate of nickel)
and carbon monoxide before or soon after reaching the alveoli
of the lungs. The nickel is dissolved from the respiratory
surface by the tissue fluids and is then taken up by the blood.
The hæmorrhages found after death follow as the result of fatty
degeneration of the vessel walls which is the specific pathological
change set up by nickel.]</p>

<p><b>Copper.</b>—Symptoms which have been described by some
writers as chronic industrial copper poisoning are probably
due to admixtures of other poisonous metals, especially lead
and arsenic. Although some copper workers, especially those
careless of cleanliness, exhibit hair and teeth coloured by the
action of copper compounds (green tinge on hair and edge
of teeth), symptoms of illness traceable to copper are not
demonstrable.</p>

<p><i>Brass-founders’ fever</i>, which by some earlier writers was
ascribed to copper or combined copper and zinc action, is
traceable to zinc (see Zinc).</p>

<p><b>Ferro-silicon.</b>—The illnesses due to this are phosphoretted
or arseniuretted hydrogen poisoning (see pp. <a href="#Page_191">191</a> and <a href="#Page_197">197</a>).</p>

<p><b>Silver and Silver Compounds.</b>—Gradual absorption of small
quantities of a solution of silver may produce industrial
argyria, often beginning with the appearance of a black
edge to the gums and darkening of the hair and nails,
followed by black spots on the skin which in severe cases
coalesce, so that the whole or almost the whole surface of the
body becomes black and glossy.</p>

<p>Argyria is due to the absorption of silver compounds
into the circulation, and subsequent deposition of the reduced
silver in the body (liver, kidneys, spinal cord, &amp;c.). The
black colouring of the skin is caused by the action of light.</p>

<p>No interference with health worth mentioning is observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>GROUP: ARSENIC, PHOSPHORUS</i></h4>

<p>The poisons (gradually absorbed) belonging to this group
are mainly such as affect metabolism; they impair the
processes essential to metabolism (in especial the oxidation
processes) and cause severe damage to the cells, through
destruction of albumen. The poisons of this group also have
a paralysing effect upon the central nervous system.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the effects produced by the poisons of
this group vary considerably. Among the arsenic compounds
arseniuretted hydrogen, which is supremely a blood poison,
must be excluded from the group and included among the
blood poisons.</p>

<h5>ARSENIC, OXIDES OF ARSENIC</h5>

<p>Pure <i>metallic arsenic</i> (As) is considered innocuous. <i>Oxides
of arsenic</i> especially are held to be industrial poisons such as
arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃), the anhydride of arsenious acid
(H₃AsO₃), a white powder, which is known under the name of
white arsenic; <i>arsenic acid</i> (H₃AsO₄), which forms crystals easily
soluble in water, and the salts of these acids, especially copper
arsenite, formerly employed in the production of dyes, and
also <i>arsenic chloride</i> (arsenic trichloride, AsCl₃). <i>Arseniuretted
hydrogen</i> will be treated separately as it has a completely
different poisonous effect from that of the oxidic compounds of
arsenic. <i>Arsenic sulphides</i> (realgar, AsS₂, and orpiment, AsS₃)
are regarded as innocuous in consequence of their insolubility
in a pure state. But it may be remarked that arsenic sulphides
(sulphur arsenic ores) which are used industrially, and even
metallic arsenic, are to be considered poisonous, as they contain
oxidic arsenic compounds in great quantity.</p>

<p>Chronic arsenical poisoning is caused by gradual absorption
through the respiratory or digestive tracts of small quantities
of the oxidic arsenic compounds either in solution or as dust
or fumes.</p>

<p>The disease usually begins with digestive derangement which
shows itself in more or less severe gastric and intestinal catarrh
(loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhœa); sometimes there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
are severe affections of the respiratory tract,—pharyngeal
and bronchial catarrhs; often the illness is accompanied by
skin affections of various kinds, rashes, pustular eczema,
loosening of the nails, abscesses, dark pigmentation of particular
parts of the skin, and other symptoms. The nervous symptoms
vary much according to the severity of the disease; first of
all, deafness and feeling of pins and needles, or loss of sensation
(paræsthesia and anæsthesia) of the extremities. Further,
rheumatic joint pains, weakness of the extremities and
characteristic symptoms of paralysis occur, with accompanying
atrophy of the muscles, and gradual loss of energy
leading to total incapacity for work. Severe cases end in
general exhaustion and loss of strength, with signs of severe
injury to the central nervous system, such as epileptic fits,
mental hebetude, &amp;c.</p>

<h5>PHOSPHORUS</h5>

<p><i>Phosphorus</i> (P) is polymorphic; red (amorphous) phosphorus
is innocuous, while white or yellow is poisonous.
Phosphorus at various stages of oxidation is little if at all
poisonous. White phosphorus is volatile and fumes in the
air—the fumes consisting of phosphorus, phosphoric and
phosphorous acids.</p>

<p>Chronic industrial phosphorus poisoning is produced by
continued inhalation of the fumes of white phosphorus
resulting in inflammation of the periosteum of the bone,
with which necrosis and formation of new bone are associated.
It attacks especially the lower jawbone (ossifying periostitis).
The inflammation begins with increased flow of saliva, painful
swelling of the gums, which, as it increases, brings about the
death of the jawbone (necrosis, phosphorus necrosis). This
becomes covered again with newly formed bone substance
from the periosteum. The process ends with the formation
of a fistula (a passage filled with pus), which discharges
outwards, and through which the dead bone (sequestrum) is
eventually cast off. Occasionally the process attacks the
upper jaw, rarely other bones.</p>

<p>With these characteristic symptoms of phosphorus
necrosis, derangement of nutrition together with anæmia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
indigestion and bronchial catarrh, may be associated. Further,
a general brittleness of the bones (fragilitas ossium) is
observed with the result that the long bones of the leg or
arm sometimes break at relatively small exertion of force;
such cases from Bohemia came lately under my notice.</p>

<p>Some authorities regard caries of the teeth as the pre-disposing
cause of phosphorus necrosis; according to this
view the carious teeth constitute the means of entrance for
the poison. Opposed to this so-called ‘local’ theory is the
view that chronic phosphorus poisoning is a ‘general’ one.
The truth may lie midway. On the one hand phosphorus
necrosis probably arises partly from the general poisonous
action of the phosphorus, and on the other from local
inflammation which leads to the occurrence of local symptoms.
The general symptoms of chronic phosphorus poisoning
described above support this view, especially the effect
observed on the bones of the skeleton. This view is also
strengthened by the fact that workmen with perfectly
sound teeth, who had been exposed to phosphorus fumes
for many years, were attacked by necrosis only when
traumatic inflammation produced by chance injury was set
up.</p>

<p>The treatment of phosphorus necrosis is surgical. Formerly
the treatment recommended was to wait for formation of new
bone and exfoliation of the dead bone (expectant treatment);
the necrosed portions of bone were then extracted through
the fistula. Recently early operative interference has succeeded
in preserving the periosteum which enabled the new
bone to form.</p>

<h5>Phosphoretted Hydrogen</h5>

<p>Industrial poisoning by gaseous phosphoretted hydrogen
(PH₃) calls for attention in connection with the preparation
and employment of calcium carbide (acetylene) and also of
ferro-silicon.</p>

<p>Phosphoretted hydrogen is a dangerous poison. Even
0·025 per cent. in the air is harmful to animals after a time;
0·2 per cent. PH₃ in the air quickly causes death.</p>

<p>The poison produces changes in the lungs, though without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
injuring the respiratory passages by corrosion, and finally has
a paralysing effect upon the central nervous system. It has
no effect upon the blood. An autopsy on a person who has
died of phosphoretted hydrogen poisoning reveals as a rule no
characteristic sign, except centres of inflammation in the lungs.</p>

<p>The symptoms of phosphoretted hydrogen poisoning are—difficulty
of breathing, cough, fainting fits, noises in the ears,
and nausea; in severe cases coma and death. Slight cases
soon recover without after-effects.</p>

<h4><i>GROUP: SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN, CARBON BISULPHIDE,
AND CYANOGEN (NERVE POISONS)</i></h4>

<p>In this group are comprised industrial poisons the principal
effect of which is upon the nervous system, especially the central
nervous system. The chemical composition of the separate
members of the group differs much.</p>

<h5>SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN</h5>

<p>Industrial poisoning by pure sulphuretted hydrogen (SH₂),
the well-known colourless, nauseous-smelling gas, occurs comparatively
rarely. Poisoning is generally acute, but chronic
illness in workers has been traced back to inhalation of
the gas.</p>

<p>This poison exerts a paralysing action upon the central
nervous system and is slightly irritating to the mucous membranes
and respiratory organs.</p>

<p>Its action can be described as follows: When absorbed
into the blood union of the poison with the alkaline constituents
takes place with formation of an alkaline sulphide. Presence
of only slight quantities of sulphuretted hydrogen in the air acts
injuriously. Lehmann has shown that about 0·15 to 0·2 per
thousand sulphuretted hydrogen is not without effect, and that
prolonged inhalation of 0·5 per thousand becomes dangerous.
Continued exposure to the poison seems only to increase
susceptibility to its action. An almost complete absorption
of the whole of the sulphuretted hydrogen present in the air
breathed takes place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Continued inhalation of small quantities of sulphuretted
hydrogen produces irritation of the mucous membrane, cough,
and lacrymation; headache, giddiness, nausea, and mental
dulness soon ensue; occasionally also symptoms of intestinal
catarrh follow; if at this stage—or after a longer exposure
to the action of a smaller amount—the patient is
withdrawn from its further influence, there still continue
for some time symptoms of irritation of the mucous membrane
(such as inflammation of the conjunctiva and of the
respiratory passages).</p>

<p>Further exposure or absorption of greater amounts induces
general discomfort and passes on to a second stage of convulsions
and delirium.</p>

<p>Inhalation of a large dose of sulphuretted hydrogen causes
almost instantaneous death; the affected person falls dead—often
without a sound—as if struck by a blow; occasionally
a short stage of unconsciousness, with symptoms of suffocation,
precede death.</p>

<p>This acute form often occurs, especially in acute sewer
gas poisoning. Besides this, a sub-acute form of sewer gas
poisoning is recognised which is attributable, in part at least,
to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, the prominent symptoms
being irritation of the mucous membranes and of the
intestinal canal. In other severe cases symptoms of the central
nervous system preponderate (headache, giddiness, and
delirium). These forms of poisoning can be caused not only
by sulphuretted hydrogen, but also by other poisonous gases
which are found in drains or sewers.</p>

<p>As regards treatment, continued inhalation of oxygen,
supported by artificial respiration, is often, in serious cases,
effective. In severe poisonings also saline injections and
bleeding may be advocated. Other symptoms (catarrh, &amp;c.)
must be treated symptomatically.</p>

<h5>CARBON BISULPHIDE</h5>

<p>Pure carbon bisulphide (CS₂) is a colourless, peculiar-smelling
liquid which boils at 46° C.</p>

<p>As Lehmann has shown, even 1·5 to 3·0 mg. CS₂ per litre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
air produces distress—with acute symptoms of poisoning
(congestion, giddiness, sickness, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>Industrial carbon bisulphide poisoning is, however,
chronic in nature and induced by continuous inhalation of
small quantities of the fumes. To understand the action of
carbon bisulphide, its capacity for dissolving fats and fatty
substances must be taken into account. Its injurious effect
extends to the nerve tissues (central and peripheral nervous
system) and the glandular tissues.</p>

<p>Throughout chronic industrial carbon bisulphide poisoning,
which has been described fully by Delpech, Laudenheimer, and
others, nervous and psychical symptoms predominate, together
with severe chronic digestive derangement.</p>

<p>The patient after exposure for some time suffers from
violent headache, giddiness, and sickness; he has sensations
of cold, pains in the limbs, a feeling of ‘needles and pins,’ and
itching in different parts of the body. Gradually a condition of
general excitement develops. Sleeplessness, cramps, and palpitation
set in. At the same time the nervous system becomes
involved—hypersensitiveness, loss of sensation or complete
numbness of some parts of the skin, diminution of muscular
power, disturbances of movement, twitching, violent trembling,
wasting of the muscles, and paralysis; the sight also is sometimes
affected. The stage of excitement, in which the patient
often becomes strikingly loquacious without cause, passes
gradually, as the nervous symptoms develop, into the stage
of depression; sometimes this takes weeks and months;
excitement and gaiety give place to deep depression; other
symptoms appear—weakness of memory, mental dulness,
and difficulty in speaking. The powers of sensation become
affected, paralysis increases, and digestive disturbances,
anæmia, and general loss of strength are manifest. Occasionally
definite mental disease (psychosis, mania, melancholia,
dementia, &amp;c.) develops.</p>

<p>Certain cases of chronic carbon bisulphide poisoning in
indiarubber workers have come under my notice, and some
remarks concerning them may be of interest. The characteristic
symptoms are essentially as follows: the invalid
appears in the consulting-room in a bent position, leaning upon
a stick with head and hands shaking. The gait is clumsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
(spastic-paralysis) so that the patient ‘steps’ rather than walks.
When seated, the tremor ceases to some extent, but in purposive
movements increases rapidly, involving the whole body,
so that an exact systematic examination becomes impossible,
and the invalid sinks back into the chair exhausted and bathed
in perspiration. He complains of cold in the extremities. He
looks pale; the skin of the upper extremities is totally without
feeling, as also is the upper part of the feet; the skin of the
head is hypersensitive; the muscular strength of the arms
is almost lost; testing the strength brings on marked shaking,
followed by a fainting-fit caused by exhaustion. The
extremities of the patient are cyanotic (livid); the knee
jerks are exaggerated. The patient suffers from indigestion,
constipation, headache, and giddiness; he is irritable, and
depressed; his memory is weak; mental derangement cannot
be proved.</p>

<p>Chronic carbon bisulphide poisoning is rarely fatal. Slight
cases end in recovery after more or less long continuance; in
severe cases improvement occasionally takes place, but serious
nervous disturbance (paralysis, weakness of the muscles,
deterioration of intellect) usually persists.</p>

<p>Treatment is symptomatic, aiming especially at relieving
the nervous symptoms and improving the state of nutrition.
If psychical disturbances are prominent, treatment in an
institution is necessary.</p>

<h5>CYANOGEN AND CYANOGEN COMPOUNDS (CYANOGEN GAS,
PRUSSIC ACID, CYANIDES)</h5>

<p>Industrial cyanogen poisoning is not frequent. <i>Cyanogen
gas</i> (C₂N₂, existing in small quantities in furnace gas, illuminating
gas, and other kinds of gas) and especially <i>hydrocyanic acid</i>
(CNH, prussic acid) are considered industrial poisons; the
latter is a very unstable, colourless, pungent-smelling liquid,
boiling at 27° C. Among the cyanides employed industrially
and having an effect similar to that of prussic acid must be
mentioned <i>cyanide of potassium</i> and <i>cyanide of sodium</i> (KCN
and NaCN), <i>cyanide of silver</i> (AgCN) and <i>cyanide of mercury</i>
(Hg[CN]₂).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Cyanogen and cyanogen compounds are extraordinarily
powerful poisons. The minimum dose lies, as Lehmann has
proved by experiments on animals, at about 0·05 per thousand
of hydrocyanic acid in the atmosphere breathed; 1-5 mg. per
kg. weight is fatal to animals; to man about 60 mg. would be
fatal.</p>

<p>The poisonous action of cyanogen and cyanogen compounds
depends upon their power of preventing absorption of oxygen
from the blood by the tissues with the result that the venous
blood flowing to the heart retains the bright red colour which
otherwise only arterial blood exhibits. This effect is due to
cessation of the gaseous exchange in the body, and results
in tissue suffocation. At the same time these poisons have at
first an exciting and then a paralysing effect upon the central
nervous system. In severe poisoning the nerve effect is
masked by the effect upon the exchange of gases in the blood,
since this quickly leads to death.</p>

<p>Most of the cases of industrial poisoning under this heading
result from inhalation; absorption of liquid cyanogen
compounds through the skin can rarely come into consideration.</p>

<p>If large quantities of hydrocyanic acid have been inhaled,
death ensues very quickly. The person affected falls down
suddenly, breathes with difficulty, the pulse soon becomes
imperceptible, and after a more or less long stage of deep
unconsciousness (coma) life becomes extinct.</p>

<p>In slight cases of poisoning the patient feels a sensation
of irritation in the throat, giddiness, sickness, and difficulty
in breathing; occasionally such disturbances persist for some
time.</p>

<p>Some writers have described symptoms in workers
manipulating prussic acid and cyanides, which they believe
to be due to chronic prussic acid poisoning. Complaint
is made of oppression of the chest, throat irritation, giddiness,
difficulty in breathing, palpitation, hebetude, exhaustion,
and nausea and vomiting; in certain instances the attack,
aggravated by exhaustion and weakness, culminates in death.
It is a question whether such poisonings are chronic in the
true sense of the word. In view of the mode of action of
hydrocyanic acid, such cases of sickness should rather be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
accounted acute or sub-acute poisonings through repeated
action of small quantities of the poison.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that in persons working with alkaline
cyanides (especially in electro-plating) skin affections occasionally
occur; these are traceable to the caustic effect of
alkaline cyanides.</p>

<p>Treatment by oxygen inhalation with simultaneous artificial
respiration holds out most prospect of success. This holds
good for acute poisoning by the other poisons belonging to
this group. Besides this, saline injections and bleeding are
recommended, and also the administration of an infusion of
sodium thiosulphate solution.</p>

<h4><i>GROUP: ARSENIURETTED HYDROGEN AND
CARBONIC OXIDE (BLOOD POISONS)</i></h4>

<p>Included in this group, as in the former one, are substances
chemically very different from each other, but of which the
action is especially on the blood. Besides this common
effect, these substances also produce various other effects, such
as local irritation, effect on the nervous system, &amp;c. The
industrial blood poisons, which according to their chemical
constitution are classed among the aliphatic and the aromatic
series of organic compounds, will, for the sake of clearness,
be discussed in the following chapters.</p>

<h5>ARSENIURETTED HYDROGEN</h5>

<p>Acute arseniuretted hydrogen poisoning, produced by
inhalation of relatively very small quantities of arseniuretted
hydrogen gas (AsH₃) is in most cases industrial in origin.
The absorption of an amount corresponding to about 0·01
mg. arsenic suffices to produce severe poisoning symptoms.
The poisonous effect results chiefly from action upon the
red blood corpuscles, which are dissolved (hæmolysis).
Arseniuretted hydrogen is therefore a genuine blood poison.
The effect upon the blood, if not immediately fatal to life,
is to cause the dissolved blood-colouring matter to pass into
the tissues where, though some is deposited, most goes to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and acts injuriously on, the organs, especially the liver, spleen,
and kidneys. In cases running at once a fatal course, the
impoverishment of the blood caused by the lack of colouring
matter necessary to internal respiration produces tissue
suffocation, which is therefore the primary cause of death.
In cases not immediately fatal, the injury to the functions of
the organs alluded to (for instance, cessation of the functions
of the kidneys, &amp;c.) may lead to death secondarily.</p>

<p>Symptoms of the disease appear often only some time after
the poisoning has set in, and begin with general malaise,
sickness, collapse, fainting fits, and difficulty of breathing;
after some hours the characteristic signs follow—the urine
becomes dark red to black, containing quantities of blood
colouring matter and dissolved constituents of the blood,
and later also bile colouring matter, so that a coppery
jaundice comes on if the illness is prolonged. The region of
the liver, spleen, and kidneys is painful. Severe cases often
end fatally during the first stage of the illness, more rarely
later, with increased difficulty of breathing; sometimes
death occurs after a preceding comatose stage marked by
convulsions and delirium. In slighter poisoning cases the
symptoms abate in a few days and recovery follows.</p>

<p>The treatment of arseniuretted hydrogen poisoning is
similar to that adopted in the case of all other blood poisonings:
in addition, if possible, direct transfusion of blood from the
artery of the giver into the vein of the receiver, liquid
nourishment, saline injections, and, above all, prolonged
oxygen inhalation.</p>

<h5>CARBONIC OXIDE (CO)</h5>

<p>Carbonic oxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless gas which
frequently causes both acute and, it is said, chronic industrial
poisoning.</p>

<p>Carbonic oxide is a very poisonous gas; even as little as
0·5 per thousand in the atmosphere breathed has a poisonous
effect; about 2-3 per thousand can be dangerous to life.</p>

<p>Its poisonous effect results from its power of combining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with the blood-colouring matter or hæmoglobin to form
carboxy-hæmoglobin; the affinity of carbonic oxide for the
hæmoglobin of the blood is more than 200 times greater than
that of oxygen, so that, however small the amount of
carbonic oxide in the air, it is inevitably absorbed by the
blood and retained. The blood so altered, assumes a cherry-red
colour, is unable to effect the necessary exchange of gases
for internal respiration, and in consequence of the lack of
oxygen suffocation ensues.</p>

<p>Without doubt, however, carbonic oxide has also an
immediate effect upon the central nervous system (first excitation,
followed quickly by paralysis). It is maintained also
that besides the action upon the hæmoglobin it favours coagulation
of the blood through the disintegration of the blood
corpuscles. The last-mentioned action is thought to account
for the sequelæ of carbonic oxide poisoning, but they can
also naturally be accounted for by the direct effect of the
poison.</p>

<p>Onset of symptoms is very sudden if a large quantity of
pure carbonic oxide is inhaled. The affected person immediately
falls down unconscious and succumbs after drawing a
few breaths with difficulty.</p>

<p>In less acute cases the illness begins with premonitory
symptoms, generally headache, sickness, giddiness, sleepiness,
though in cases of fairly rapid absorption these are absent,
and are naturally absent also when the poisoning creeps upon
the affected persons while asleep, as occasionally happens
in cabins, &amp;c., in factories. If the poisoning continues, increasing
mental dulness, accompanied by nausea and vomiting,
leads sometimes to a short stage of seemingly drunken excitement,
which preludes deep unconsciousness during which there
is often a convulsive stage, followed by complete loss both of
sensation and of reflex action; the breathing becomes shallow
and intermittent, the pulse small and irregular, and finally
death ensues. Occasionally in the stage of unconsciousness,
death is hastened by entrance of vomited matter into the
respiratory passages. Bright red patches are seen on the body
after death.</p>

<p>If persons affected by severe carbonic oxide poisoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
are withdrawn from the poisonous atmosphere after having
reached the stage of unconsciousness, they may recover,
but often with difficulty; not infrequently—in spite of suitable
treatment—death occurs some considerable time later
from the symptoms described above. Still, in many cases,
under the influence of right treatment, gradual recovery
has been brought about, even after long unconsciousness
accompanied by repeated convulsions. In the rescued the
symptoms described as characteristic of the first stage often
continue for at least a day. Further, they are liable to a
number of serious after effects, such as severe inflammation
of the lungs due to infection by the entrance of vomited
matter into the air passages, skin affections (rashes),
and especially severe nervous and mental affections. Frequently
these develop from centres of softening in the brain
or from inflammation of the peripheral nerves (neuritis);
occasionally the poisoning may really only be the predisposing
cause for the outbreak of an existing psychical disease. It is
not our task to enumerate all the extremely varied disturbances
which are observed after carbonic acid gas poisoning.
Neuralgias and paralyses have been described as associated
with the peripheral nerve symptoms over areas supplied by
different nerves; various forms of diseases of the brain and
spinal cord (poliomyelitis, paralysis, sclerosis, &amp;c.); and finally
a series of psychoses (neurasthenia, melancholia, mania, &amp;c.),
occasionally passing into dementia and imbecility. Glycosuria
(sugar in the urine) has also been noted as a sequela.</p>

<p>Chronic carbonic oxide poisoning, arising from continued
inhalation of small quantities of the gas, sets in usually
with symptoms similar to those of acute carbonic oxide
poisoning; if the worker continues exposed to danger, severe
symptoms may arise which point to marked alteration of
the blood and later also of the digestion and bodily functions.
Under certain circumstances severe nervous and mental
affections are said to occur similar to those which we have
mentioned as sequelæ of acute carbonic oxide poisoning (convulsions,
disturbances of mental activity, symptoms which
resemble progressive muscular atrophy, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>In acute carbonic oxide poisoning oxygen inhalation indefatigably
continued and supported by artificial respiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
is often successful. The serious danger from this form of
poisoning renders it very necessary that in all premises where
there is risk provision should be made for the administration
of oxygen. The sequelæ can of course only be treated
symptomatically.</p>

<h5>OXYCHLORIDE OF CARBON (PHOSGENE)</h5>

<p>Oxychloride of carbon (COCl₂), also called phosgene, is, at
the ordinary temperature, a colourless gas with a disagreeable
smell. This decomposes in moist air into carbonic oxide,
hydrochloric acid, or chlorine, and produces a strongly irritant
local effect upon the mucous membranes. Industrial poisoning
by phosgene is characterised by great difficulty in breathing
and inflammation of the respiratory tract (bronchitis and
bloodstained expectoration).</p>

<p>Several cases have been treated successfully by oxygen
inhalation.</p>

<h5>NICKEL CARBONYL</h5>

<p>The effects of nickel carbonyl are described on pp.
<a href="#Page_186">186-8</a>.</p>

<h5>CARBONIC ACID</h5>

<p>Carbonic acid (CO₂), a colourless gas, is heavier than air
(specific weight, 1·526), and therefore, wherever it collects,
sinks to the ground. Carbonic acid is only very slightly
poisonous; about 10 per cent. carbonic acid in the air
causes asphyxia. The extinguishing of a candle flame will
serve as an indication that the amount of carbonic acid in
the atmosphere has reached this point. Cases of industrial
carbonic acid asphyxia are sudden; they do not occur
frequently.</p>

<p>The gradual action of the gas when mixed with air produces
first a tingling sensation on the surface of the body,
reddening of the face, irritation of the mucous membrane
and the respiratory organs, after which succeed difficulty in
breathing, palpitation, fainting, and unconsciousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Sudden and fatal poisoning occurs industrially. Upon
entering places filled with carbonic acid gas the affected person
falls down dead almost immediately. These are cases of
asphyxia, in which the lack of oxygen certainly plays the
greatest part. If those affected by acute carbonic acid
poisoning are removed in time out of the dangerous atmosphere
they usually recover quickly.</p>

<p>Oxygen inhalations and artificial respiration are to be
applied in severer cases. There are no sequelæ.</p>

<h4><i>GROUP: HYDROCARBONS OF THE ALIPHATIC AND
AROMATIC SERIES AND THEIR HALOGEN AND
HYDROXYL SUBSTITUTION PRODUCTS</i></h4>

<p>The industrial poisons comprised in this group have as their
principal general effect injurious action upon the functions
of the central nervous system (paralysis or causing excitation)
which is prominent in most of the cases of industrial
poisoning caused by these substances. This effect is most
marked in the case of the readily volatile (low boiling) hydrocarbons,
while those less volatile and boiling at a higher
temperature often have collateral effects (such as local irritation).
The characteristic poisonous effect caused by the
chlorine and hydroxyl-substitution products (chloroform and
alcohol group) is also mainly on the central nervous system
(narcosis).</p>

<h5>HYDROCARBONS OF MINERAL OIL<br />
BENZINE, LIGROINE, PETROLEUM, PARAFFIN, VASELINE</h5>

<p><i>Mineral oil</i> (crude petroleum) has, according to its origin,
differing composition. Thus in American mineral oil hydrocarbons
of the methane series preponderate; in the Russian,
hydrocarbons of the aromatic series. Reference has been
made in Part I. to this point, as well as to the separation of
crude petroleum into its different fractions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The injury to health produced by crude petroleum and its
derivatives is of two kinds. Direct contact with liquid petroleum
and the semi-liquid and solid deposit after distillation
(paraffin) cause local injury to the skin. Inhalation of the
volatile constituents of raw petroleum causes symptoms
affecting mainly the central nervous system. They have
moreover a markedly irritating effect upon the mucous membrane
of the respiratory organs. These substances clearly
exhibit the characteristic we have referred to, namely, that
the hydrocarbons boiling at low temperature act as nerve
poisons, whereas those boiling at a higher temperature produce
a local irritant effect.</p>

<p>The skin affections take the form of inflammation of the
hair follicles (acne), eruptions with characteristic formation
of vesicles, and pimples and pustules which precede the deep-seated
formation of ulcers, abscesses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In paraffin workers the acne-like skin inflammations are
known as ‘paraffin eczema.’ They develop sometimes into
cancer of the skin (warty and epitheliomatous growths).</p>

<p>In the general poisoning produced by inhalation of petroleum
fumes the effect upon the central nervous system is all
the more plainly and clearly marked when the irritant effect of
the hydrocarbons boiling at higher temperature is slight or
absent; that is, in the case of poisoning which arises solely
from industrial products of low boiling hydrocarbons; among
these benzine is included.</p>

<p>Acute poisoning from inhalation of benzine fumes begins
with headache, sickness, and attacks of giddiness resembling
alcoholic intoxication. If very much has been inhaled, the
patient quickly becomes unconscious, with occasionally
muscular tremors, convulsions, difficulty in breathing, and
cyanosis.</p>

<p>In cases of poisoning by inhalation of fumes of crude petroleum,
these symptoms may be complicated by coughing,
intense inflammation of the mucous membrane of the respiratory
organs—congestion, bronchitis, bloodstained expectoration,
and inflammation of the lungs. In workers who
frequently remain long in an atmosphere filled with benzine
fumes, further symptoms of chronic benzine poisoning show
themselves—mental hebetude, pains in the limbs, trembling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
weakness of the muscles, and other disturbances of the nervous
system; in such cases these may really be signs of continued
attacks of acute or sub-acute poisoning; many benzine
workers are anæmic.</p>

<p>The treatment of acute benzine poisoning consists in
oxygen inhalation, with simultaneous artificial respiration.
Treatment of chronic derangement of health is symptomatic.</p>

<h5>HYDROCARBONS OF THE AROMATIC SERIES<br />
BENZENE AND ITS HOMOLOGUES</h5>

<p><i>Benzene</i> (C₆H₆) is a characteristically smelling (aromatic)
liquid which boils at 80·5° C. Acute benzene poisoning,
which plays an important part as an industrial poisoning, is
caused by inhalation of benzene fumes. The various kinds
of benzol used commercially contain, besides benzene,
alkyl benzenes, especially <i>toluene</i> (methylbenzene, C₆H₅.CH₃,
boiling-point 111° C.); <i>xylene</i> (dimethylbenzene, C₆H₄[CH₃]₂,
boiling-point 140° C.); <i>pseudocumene</i> and <i>mesitylene</i> (tri-methylbenzene,
C₆H₃[CH₃]₃, boiling-point 169° or 163° C.); the
regular presence of <i>thiophene</i> (C₄H₄S, boiling-point 84° C.) in
commercial benzol must also be taken into account. Industrial
benzol poisoning arises, therefore, as a rule, not from the
action of pure benzene vapour, but from fumes which contain
a mixture of the compounds mentioned.</p>

<p>The course run by industrial benzol poisoning is often very
acute, if large quantities are inhaled—death occurring suddenly,
after a short illness with symptoms of vertigo. Gradual
inhalation of lesser quantities gives rise to headache, giddiness,
malaise, then twitchings appear which develop into convulsions,
and lastly unconsciousness. In order to ascertain in
what manner the various substances contained in commercial
benzol share in the poisonous effect, experimental research
seemed to me to be indispensable, especially as published statements
so far gave no accurate data.</p>

<p>Two cases of industrial benzol poisoning have given rise
to close experimental research upon the poisonous nature of
benzene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Lewin undertook experiments on animals; which he confined
under bells and caused to inhale fumes of chemically pure and
impure benzene. He mentions that even at comparatively low
concentration poisoning results, and indeed more readily and
certainly from the action of impure than pure benzene. Lewin
found that when air was made to flow slowly first through
benzene and then into the bell, symptoms of paralysis, convulsions,
and unconsciousness showed themselves in from four to
six minutes. After-effects by this means could not be observed.
Lewin maintains, however, that in man even slight acute
action of benzene can be followed by after-effects (giddiness,
sickness, headache, distress in breathing, and oppression of
the heart).</p>

<p>Santesson made researches upon the poisonous action of
benzene in connection with occurrence of certain cases of poisoning
through ‘impure benzol’ (coal-tar benzene) in a rubber tyre
factory. In the factory mentioned nine young women were
poisoned, of whom four died. The symptoms shown were
lassitude, anæmia, giddiness, headache, vomiting, and fever.
Post mortem, hæmorrhages and fatty degeneration of the
endothelium of the bloodvessels and various organs were
found. Experimental research showed that commercial
benzol and chemically pure benzene had the same effect.
Santesson did not succeed in his experiments on animals in
producing chronic poisoning by inhalation of benzine and of
benzene fumes (which two completely different poisons he does
not distinguish strictly from each other, as is the case, unfortunately,
with many other writers). My experimental researches
upon the poisonous effect of pure benzene, pure toluene,
cumene, thiophene, and the most important kinds of commercial
benzol gave the following results:</p>

<p>For rabbits the limit of toxicity is a proportion of 0·015
to 0·016 per thousand pure benzene in the air, that is 0·015
to 0·016 c.c. benzene vapour per litre of air.</p>

<p>A concentration of 0·056-0·057 per thousand pure benzene in
the air causes in rabbits at once—after one minute—twitching
of the muscles; after eight minutes, convulsions; after ten
minutes, deep narcosis; and after twenty-five minutes, coma.
If the animal is taken out of the bell in time, even if it has
shown marked symptoms, it recovers very quickly (in two to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
ten minutes) without manifesting any after effects. Even in
animals repeatedly exposed to the poison sequelæ were not
observed.</p>

<p>Dogs are somewhat more susceptible to pure benzene than
rabbits; 0·024 per thousand causes after ten minutes severe
convulsions, which after twenty minutes become continuous;
0·042 per thousand kills after twenty minutes (sudden death
in a state of tetanus).</p>

<p>Cats are less sensitive than dogs and more sensitive than
rabbits; 0·03-0·04 per thousand causes after ten minutes
attacks of cramp and, after twenty minutes, convulsions; 0·05
per thousand at once brings on poisoning symptoms. As
regards the character of the symptoms (cramps, convulsions,
quick recovery, no after effects) the above statements apply
to all three kinds of animals (rabbit, dog, and cat).</p>

<p>Chloral hydrate completely checks the convulsions and
enables animals to tolerate higher concentrations of benzene for
a longer time.</p>

<p>Benzene is thus to be counted among nerve irritant poisons.
The convulsions are probably provoked by excitement of the
motor centres in the brain.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that thiophene in a concentration of
0·03-0·05 per thousand in the air was borne by animals for
an hour without producing any symptoms of poisoning, the
proportion of thiophene in commercial benzol must be looked
upon as practically non-injurious.</p>

<p>The so-called 90 <i>benzol</i>—a commercial benzol of which
90 per cent. distils at 100° C.—has naturally a somewhat
weaker action, although, in respect of the poisoning symptoms
produced, it is similar to that of pure benzene.</p>

<p><i>Pure toluene</i> (boiling-point 111° C.) and purified toluol
(commercial product, boiling-point 109°-112° C.) produce, when
inhaled, gradually increasing narcosis in the three kinds of
animals referred to; they produce no symptoms of convulsions
or spasms.</p>

<p>After the animals have been taken out of the bell, recovery
is not so rapid as after benzine inhalation, but takes from
half an hour to one hour. In rabbits and cats 0·046-0·05 per
thousand produces after fifteen minutes staggering and paresis;
after thirty minutes deep narcosis. The dog is again somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
more susceptible, as little as 0·034 per thousand causing these
symptoms in the same time.</p>

<p>‘Purified toluol’ (commercial product) acts somewhat
less rapidly than pure toluene, but this small difference in
effect need hardly be considered.</p>

<p>Other poisons were also investigated:—</p>

<p><i>Solvent naphtha I</i>, a commercial product, of which 90 per
cent. comes over at 160° C.; it contains little toluene, chiefly
xylene, pseudocumene, and cumene.</p>

<p><i>Solvent naphtha II</i>, of which 90 per cent. comes over at
175° C, it contains besides xylene, chiefly pseudocumene,
mesitylene, cumene, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fumes of solvent naphtha I cause, when inhaled by
rabbits, dogs, and cats, gradual narcosis, although not nearly
so quickly as toluene at similar concentrations; recovery usually
takes over an hour after the deeply narcotised animals have
been removed from the bell. Rabbits and cats are affected in
about equal degree. The dog is the more sensitive. Rabbits
and cats can tolerate about 0·012-0·013 per thousand of the
fumes of solvent naphtha I in the atmosphere for a long time
without any symptoms. Only after breathing for fifty minutes
air containing 0·0536 per thousand do they become narcotised.
In the dog 0·036 per thousand causes narcosis only
after thirty minutes.</p>

<p>With the fumes of solvent naphtha II I could not affect
rabbits at all. The cat also, in spite of long inhalation of the
heavy fumes, showed no marked symptoms of poisoning. In
the dog gradual narcosis came about only after an hour’s
inhalation of 0·048 per thousand.</p>

<p>The fumes of pure <i>xylene</i> caused narcosis in rabbits after
forty minutes’ inhalation of 0·05 per thousand in the atmosphere;
after being taken out of the bell the animals recovered
slowly (after half an hour to one hour).</p>

<p><i>Cumene</i> causes no symptoms after one hour’s inhalation in
a concentration of 0·06 to 0·07 per thousand. This explains
the effects of solvent naphtha I (in which xylene preponderates)
and solvent naphtha II (in which pseudocumene, cumene, &amp;c.,
preponderate). After effects were not observed.</p>

<p>Benzol and toluol fumes, and particularly those of solvent
naphtha, exercise a distinctly irritant effect upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
mucous membrane, which, however, passes off without after
effects.</p>

<p>Pure benzene, therefore, proved the most poisonous of
the substances under investigation. When inhaled its effect
(convulsions, with quick recovery) differs essentially from that
of toluene, solvent naphtha, xylene, and cumene (gradual
narcosis, slow recovery). The fumes of the various kinds of
commercial benzol (solvent naphtha) boiling at a higher
temperature are practically non-poisonous (solvent naphtha
II). Pure benzene fumes are, however poisonous, even in
very small quantities in the air. The limit for animals lies at
0·015-0·016 per thousand.</p>

<p>Lehmann has shown in a recent work that man, exposed
to a mixture of benzene and air, absorbs 80 per cent. of the
benzene.</p>

<p>Treatment of acute industrial benzene poisoning consists
in severe cases of artificial respiration, with simultaneous
administration of oxygen; in slight cases it is sufficient to
bring the patient into fresh air.</p>

<p><i>Naphthalene.</i>—Naphthalene, which is insoluble in water,
has irritant effect upon the mucous membrane and upon the
skin when brought into contact with it.</p>

<p>Long continuance in an atmosphere containing naphthalene
as dust or fumes causes headache, nausea, giddiness, &amp;c.</p>

<h5>HALOGEN SUBSTITUTION PRODUCTS<br />
ALIPHATIC SERIES (NARCOTIC POISONS)</h5>

<p>The halogen substitution products of the aliphatic series
are not of much account as industrial poisons. They have
generally a narcotic effect, that is, a paralysing effect upon the
central nervous system, usually preceded by a short stage of
excitement. This effect shows itself typically on inhalation
of chloroform (methanetrichloride, CHCl₃), which however plays
no part as an industrial poison. The narcotic effect of the
other alkyl chlorides is less than that of chloroform. With
carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) the narcotic effect is only half
that of chloroform; it causes, however, a more violent excitation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
inhaling the fumes brings on nausea, coughing, sickness,
headache, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Methylchloride</i> (CH₃Cl) has a less narcotising effect. On
the other hand it has a stronger local irritant action, which is
indeed present also in chloroform, though not so apparent.
This gas, as is well known, is used as a local anæsthetic in
medicine.</p>

<p>Pure <i>methylene chloride</i> (CH₂Cl₂) similarly is much less
powerful than chloroform. Severe poisoning, alleged to
have resulted from methylene chloride was caused by a
mixture, called indeed methylene chloride, but composed of
methylalcohol and chloroform.</p>

<p>Of the remaining halogen substitution products of methane,
<i>methyl bromide</i> (CH₃Br) and <i>methyl iodide</i> (CH₃I) have given
rise to industrial poisoning.</p>

<p>These poisons also act in the same way as the alkyl chlorides,
but the excitement accompanying the narcosis is more marked—so
far as the scanty observations allow conclusions to be
drawn. The symptoms first show themselves in sickness,
giddiness, hebetude, slowing of respiratory movements and
of the heart’s action; convulsions or delirium ensue.</p>

<p>Treatment consists in artificial respiration or promotion of
breathing by a plentiful supply of fresh air or oxygen; in
pronounced narcosis stimulating remedies should be applied.</p>

<h5>BENZENE SERIES</h5>

<p><i>Chlorobenzene</i>, and <i>nitro-</i> and <i>dinitro-chlorobenzene</i> and
<i>benzoylchloride</i>, have given rise to industrial poisoning.</p>

<p>To chlorobenzene similar action is attributed as to benzene
(headache, fainting, rapid breathing, cyanosis); changes in the
blood (methæmoglobin formation) have also been observed.</p>

<p>Nitro- and dinitro-chlorobenzene are active poisons; the
effect corresponds in general to that of nitro- and dinitrobenzene,
but in addition the fumes or dust have markedly
irritant action on the skin (dermatitis).</p>

<p><i>Benzoylchloride</i> (C₆H₅COCl), a colourless, pungent-smelling
liquid, produces a violently irritant effect upon the mucous
membrane, decomposing into hydrochloric acid and benzoic
acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Treatment is analogous to that of benzene poisoning, and
in cases of benzoyl chloride poisoning to that by hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that chlorine rash is attributed to the
action of chlorinated tar products (chlorobenzene compounds).</p>

<h5>HYDROXYL SUBSTITUTION PRODUCTS<br />
FATTY SERIES (ALCOHOLS)</h5>

<p>The hydroxyl substitution products of the fatty series
belong mainly to the narcotic poisons; the greater the molecular
weight of the alcohol, the more marked is usually the
narcotic effect. According to this propylalcohol is eighteen
times as poisonous as ethylalcohol; butylalcohol and amylalcohol
have from 36 to 120 times as great a narcotic effect as
methylalcohol.</p>

<p><i>Methylalcohol</i> (wood spirit, CH₃OH) plays relatively the
greatest part among alcohols as an industrial poison, because
it is employed as a means of denaturing spirit. Its poisonous
nature is relatively great, being very persistent. Industrial
poisoning by methylalcohol is due to inhalation of the
vapour and is rarely of a severe nature. The fumes have
a strongly irritant effect upon the mucous membrane, giving
rise to throat irritation, cough, hoarseness, and in severe
cases bronchitis and inflammation of the conjunctiva of the
eye. In addition inhalation of methylalcohol vapour causes
headache, giddiness, nausea (inclination to vomit), and
occasionally also twitchings and tremor.</p>

<p>The <i>higher alcohols</i> (propyl-, butyl-, amyl-alcohol, C₃H₇.OH,
C₄H₉.OH, and C₅H₁₁.OH) occur in fusel oil. They cause but
slight (if any) industrial poisoning. Cases of more severe
industrial poisoning through amylalcohol fumes have been
described (in factories for smokeless powder), with symptoms
of sickness, headache, giddiness, with fatal issue in some cases,
preceded by severe nervous symptoms (convulsions or
delirium).</p>

<p>Beyond speedy removal out of the dangerous atmosphere,
probably no special treatment is needed in these cases of
industrial poisoning from alcoholic vapour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>GROUP: NITRO AND AMIDO COMPOUNDS OF THE
ALIPHATIC AND AROMATIC SERIES (BLOOD
POISONS WHICH FORM METHÆMOGLOBIN)</i></h4>

<p>Characteristic of the nitro and amido compounds of the
aliphatic and aromatic series of the organic substances is
their action upon the blood. The normal oxyhæmoglobin
(blood-colouring matter) is changed into methæmoglobin,
with which the oxygen is so firmly combined that
the internal exchange of gases necessary to life becomes
impossible. Methæmoglobin has a dark chocolate-brown
colour and a clearly defined characteristic spectrum.</p>

<p>Of the poisons belonging to this group several are important.
In so far as these substances are volatile—and this is generally
the case with those causing industrial poisoning—effects are
due to inhalation of fumes, but it is proved that the poisons of
this group in liquid form can be absorbed by the intact skin,
and this channel of absorption is characteristic of industrial
poisoning. Severe poisoning results especially from wetting
the skin by spilling on the clothes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The grey-blue discoloration of the mucous membrane,
especially of the lips, is characteristic; sometimes also the skin
is altered in colour. This discoloration is often noticed
by others before the patient feels unwell. Soon the
person affected has general nausea, vomiting, headache,
giddiness, severe nervous symptoms, feeling of anxiety,
and difficulty of breathing; in severe cases unconsciousness
comes on, and death occurs with increasing cyanosis
(lividity).</p>

<p>Treatment is naturally that which has been emphasised in the
introductory words to Part II, which hold for all blood poisonings.
In mild cases oxygen treatment has given good results.
In all factories where such poisoning can occur provision should
be made for immediate oxygen treatment. Besides this, the
workers must be adequately instructed as to the danger and
symptoms of poisoning, especially of the characteristic premonitory
skin discoloration, in order to be able to assist their
fellows.</p>

<h5>NITROCOMPOUNDS<br />
ALIPHATIC SERIES</h5>

<p><i>Nitro-glycerin</i> (triple nitric acid ester of glycerin,
C₃H₅.[NO₃]₃), the well-known oily explosive liquid, has also an
irritant local effect. When absorbed into the body, in addition
to methæmoglobin formation, it causes dilatation of the bloodvessels,
slowing of the respiration and heart’s action, and attacks
of suffocation. The general remarks upon this group apply here,
but symptoms referable to central paralysis occur as the
methæmoglobin formation is slow. Industrial poisoning arises
through inhalation of gases containing nitro-glycerin and
also by absorption through the skin. Statements as to its
poisonous nature are very varied. Under certain conditions
moistening the skin with small quantities of nitro-glycerin
suffices to produce symptoms. Probably the susceptibility of
different persons varies greatly.</p>

<p><i>Amylnitrite</i> (nitric acid amyl ester, C₅H₁₁NO₂), a characteristically
smelling liquid, acts similarly. The fumes of
amylnitrite, even when inhaled in small quantities, cause
marked dilatation of the bloodvessels, through paralysis of the
muscular walls of the bloodvessels, thus causing marked flushing
of the face; the pulse becomes quick, then weak and slow.</p>

<h5>NITRO AND AMIDO COMPOUNDS<br />
AROMATIC SERIES</h5>

<p>The substances of this group are important.</p>

<p><i>Nitrobenzene</i> (C₆H₅NO₂, named oil of mirbane), a yellowish
liquid of characteristic smell, induces especially the formation
of methæmoglobin in the blood; the effect upon the central
nervous system (first excitation, then depression) is often
absent. The description of the disease in general in the
introductory words of this whole group is characteristic.
Occasionally signs of asphyxia show themselves; sometimes
there are twitchings, disturbance of the power of sensation,
and convulsions; early discoloration of the mucous membrane
and the skin, which assume a blue to grey-black colour, is
characteristic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Chronic poisoning is also attributed to nitrobenzene, showing
itself in lassitude, headache, malaise, giddiness, and other
disturbances of the nervous system.</p>

<p><i>Nitrotoluene</i> (C₆H₄CH₃NO₂), of which the ortho-compound
acts most powerfully, and also <i>nitroxylene</i> (C₆H₃[CH₃]₂NO₂)
have similar but less marked effect.</p>

<p>The <i>dinitrobenzenes</i> (C₆H₄[NO₂]₂) are stable bodies. Meta-dinitrobenzene
inhaled as dust or otherwise, can produce
marked poisoning symptoms essentially the same as those
described. Especially characteristic is the early dark
discoloration of the skin.</p>

<p>Symptoms resembling nitrobenzene poisoning in general
are caused by <i>nitrophenols</i> (C₆H₄.OH.NO₂), of which
paranitrophenol is the most toxic; also by <i>dinitrophenols</i>
(C₆H₃[NO₂]₂OH), solid crystalline substances which melt at
different temperatures, and the <i>mono-</i> and <i>di-nitrochlorobenzenes</i>
(C₆H₄.Cl.NO₂ and C₆H₃.Cl[NO₂]₂). In cases of industrial
poisoning by dinitrophenol, observed by Leymann, the
workers were taken suddenly ill, with symptoms of collapse,
pains in the chest, vomiting, distress of breathing, rapid pulse,
and convulsions, and died within a few hours. At the autopsy
a yellow substance was found with picric acid reaction which
appeared to be di- or tri-nitrophenol. In other cases, some
fatal, of industrial nitrochlorobenzene poisoning, also observed
by Leymann, the typical grey-blue discoloration of the skin
was obvious, and the chocolate-brown colour of the blood
produced by methæmoglobin.</p>

<p><i>Trinitrophenol</i> (picric acid, C₆H₂[NO₂]₃OH) is a yellow
crystalline compound with bitter taste; poisoning by this
substance exhibits clearly strong local irritant action (upon
skin, mucous membrane, and intestinal canal, and especially
upon the kidneys), besides effect on the blood and central
nervous system. Prolonged action of picric acid upon the skin
causes inflammation. Absorption of picric acid dust causes
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the respiratory
passages and symptoms of gastric and intestinal catarrh as well
as inflammation of the kidneys.</p>

<p>A jaundice-like discoloration of the skin and darkening
of the urine are also characteristic; sometimes picric acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
poisoning produces a rash resembling that of measles and
scarlet fever.</p>

<p><i>Nitronaphthalene</i> (C₁₀H₇[NO₂]) and <i>nitronaphthol</i>
(C₁₀H₆.NO₂.OH) in addition to methæmoglobin formation
have an irritant action. It is stated also that dulness of
the cornea is produced.</p>

<p><i>Azobenzenes</i> also, which are to be considered as intermediate
between nitrobenzene and aniline, form methæmoglobin (azobenzene,
C₆H₅N = NH₅C₆).</p>

<p><i>Aniline</i> (amidobenzene, C₆H₅.NH₂), a colourless, oily liquid
of aromatic smell, has only slight local irritant effect. In the
frequent cases of industrial poisoning by ‘aniline oil’ or aniline
hydrochloride, in which the aniline enters through the skin or is
inhaled in the form of fume, there appear the typical symptoms
common to this group, of the action upon the blood
through methæmoglobin formation: headache, weakness,
cyanosis, difficulty in breathing, &amp;c., to which are added
nervous symptoms such as convulsions and psychical disturbance,
although these play a subordinate part in industrial
poisoning. In severe cases the typical symptoms of air
hunger are shown. Occasionally recovery only takes place
gradually, and signs of irritation of the kidneys and inflammation
of the urinary organs are seen. These symptoms occur
only rarely in acute industrial poisoning, but are, however,
in so far worthy of notice because of the frequent occurrence
of tumours in the bladder among aniline workers. It is
possible that here the irritant action of the urine which contains
aniline plays a part. The tumours in the bladder operated
upon, in some cases with success, were many of them non-malignant
(papillomata), but some were carcinomata (cancerous
new growths) running a malignant course, and recurring after
operation. In the urine the aniline combines with sulphuric
acid, and is partly excreted as paramidophenol sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>The treatment of aniline poisoning is the same as that for
all the poisons of this group. In view of the occurrence
of tumours of the bladder in aniline workers, they should
be instructed to seek medical aid on the first indications of
trouble, so that a careful cystoscopic examination may be
made.</p>

<p><i>Toluidine</i> (C₆H₄.CH₃.NH₂), which is mixed with aniline for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
industrial use, produces the same symptoms with marked
irritation of the renal organs.</p>

<p>Of the <i>nitroanilines</i> (C₆H₄.NH₂.NO₂) <i>paranitroaniline</i> is
the most poisonous. Characteristic of the action of this compound
is methæmoglobin formation, central paralysis and
paralysis of the heart’s action.</p>

<p>Of the <i>benzenediamines</i>, <i>paraphenylene diamine</i> (C₆H₄[NH₂]₂)
may be regarded as an industrial poison. The irritant action
of this substance is prominent; it induces skin affections, inflammation
of the mucous membranes, more especially of the
respiratory organs, and sometimes inflammation of the kidneys.
They have been noted in workers using ursol as a dye; here,
doubtless, the action of diimine (C₆H₄.NH.NH.) must be taken
into account, which arises as an intermediate product and
exercises a markedly irritant action. Further, the general
effect of paraphenylene diamine is an irritant one upon the
central nervous system.</p>

<h4><i>APPENDIX</i><br />
TURPENTINE, PYRIDINE BASES, ALKALOIDS</h4>

<p><i>Turpentine oil.</i>.—Turpentine oil is a peculiar-smelling,
colourless liquid of the composition C₁₀H₁₆; different reactions
show that turpentine oil contains the aromatic nucleus
(cymene). It is used in the manufacture of varnish, and thus
can cause industrial poisoning by inhalation of fumes. Even
from 3 to 4 mg. of vapour of turpentine oil per litre of air
brings on severe symptoms. Turpentine oil acts as a local
irritant, and when absorbed into the system has an exciting
effect upon the central nervous system. Inhalation of large
quantities of turpentine vapour cause rapid breathing,
palpitation, giddiness, stupor, convulsions, and other
nervous disturbances, pains in the chest, bronchitis, and
inflammation of the kidneys. The last-mentioned symptom
also arises from the chronic action of turpentine vapours.</p>

<p><i>Pyridine.</i>—Pyridine (C₅H₅N), a colourless liquid of peculiar
odour, is employed as well as methylalcohol in denaturing
alcohol. The disturbance of health observed in workers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
occupied with the denatured spirit are probably mainly
due to the inhalation of fumes of methylalcohol. Pyridine is
comparatively innocuous. Eczema, from which persons suffer
who come into contact with denatured spirit, is ascribed to the
action of pyridine. Larger doses produce a paralysing effect,
but this need not be considered in its industrial use.</p>

<p><i>Nicotine, tobacco.</i>—According to various published statements,
effects among tobacco factory workers are attributed
to the nicotine contained in tobacco dust and to the aroma
which fills the air. Nicotine in large doses has at first an
exciting followed by a paralysing effect upon the central
nervous system; it causes moreover contraction of the
unstriped muscles and has a local irritant effect.</p>

<p>The symptoms of illness ascribed to nicotine are: conjunctivitis,
catarrh of the air passages, palpitation, headache,
want of appetite, and, particularly, tendency to abortion
and excessive menstruation. Severe industrial poisoning due
to nicotine has only been observed in workers who chewed
tobacco leaves.</p>

<p><i>Poisonous wood.</i>—The symptoms of disease noticed in
workers who manipulate certain kinds of wood are attributed
by some writers to the presence of alkaloids. Such knowledge
as we have of the illness due to them—they are evidently
of the nature of poisoning—is referred to at the end of Part I.</p>

<h2 id="PART_III">PART III<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST INDUSTRIAL POISONING</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="GENERAL_MEASURES">I<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>GENERAL MEASURES</i></span></h3>

<p>In discussing preventive measures against industrial poisoning
the deductive method from the general to the particular
will be followed. The numerous instances of poisoning
mentioned in Part I afford a practical basis on which to
formulate general rules before passing on to describe special
measures. Technical details will be omitted, as they must be
left to the technical expert whose business it is to draw up the
plans as a whole and to modify them according to the requirements
of individual cases.</p>

<p>In the effort to control industrial poisoning and disease it
is necessary to insist absolutely on the concerted action of all
concerned. In this co-operation every one is called who
through his knowledge and sphere of activity is in a position to
assist.</p>

<p>The medical man comes in with his special knowledge of the
action of poisons as toxicologist, as practising physician (especially
as works surgeon and doctor of the sick insurance society),
and also in an official capacity as appointed surgeon or medical
officer of health; the technical expert comes in as engineer, as
manager, as foreman, and as factory inspector. But above
all the interest and active co-operation of employers and
employed are needed as well as the organisations of both.
That the workers should understand and co-operate is essential
for the success of preventive measures, and subsequently it
will be shown in what direction this co-operation is most
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>To make possible such co-operation interest must be
aroused and suitable information and teaching supplied to the
parties concerned. Medical men and practical workers require
to receive instruction in industrial hygiene, and teaching on
this subject should be arranged for in secondary and technical
schools. Medical men and others who, as officials and insurance
doctors, are brought constantly into touch with industrial
workers should have opportunity—by means of special courses
and lectures—to keep pace with advancing knowledge in this
direction. Beside these there are, as educative organisations,
special Institutes of Industrial Hygiene and special hospitals
for treatment of diseases of occupation which bring together
the patients and the teaching staff and so facilitate pursuit of
knowledge and research. A beginning of this kind has
already been made by the Industrial Hygiene Institute,
Frankfurt a.-Main, and the hospital for diseases of occupation
at Milan, showing that the ideas are attainable. International
agencies which unite all circles interested in the
subject irrespective of profession or nationality in common
interchange of thought and discussion are of great significance
for uniform development of needful preventive measures;
international congresses, often in connection with exhibitions,
have given valuable stimulus and have been the starting-point
of permanent international societies, unions, and organisations.
The significance for our inquiry of these international efforts
will be more closely considered in the following pages.</p>

<h3>II<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON SOCIAL AND LEGISLATIVE MEASURES</i></span></h3>

<h4>INTERNATIONAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES, NOTIFICATION OF
INDUSTRIAL POISONING, LISTS AND SCHEDULES OF INDUSTRIAL
POISONS</h4>

<p>Experience and inquiry in the field of industrial poisoning
led to a series of demands which, supported as they were by a
general movement for the protection of workers, were soon
followed by regulations and legislative action. For a long time
efforts have been directed to treat industrial disease and poisoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in the same way as has been done in the case of industrial
accidents. The question, however, is attended with much
greater difficulty. On the other hand, uniform international
regulation of questions affecting prevention of disease is called
for both on humanitarian and economic grounds.</p>

<p>The idea of international legislation for the protection of
workers was first mooted about the year 1870. The possibility
and need of such intervention was much discussed and interest
in it kept constantly alive, especially in Switzerland, until
the organisations of the workers took up the idea. Several
attempts failed. In France in 1883 a proposal of the Socialist
party aiming at international agreement on the subject of
protection of the workers was rejected. In 1885 (in opposition
to Hertling) Prince Bismarck expressed himself strongly against
the possibility of such international protection. But the stone,
once set rolling, could not be stayed. In the years 1886, 1887,
and 1888 the French and English trade unions, as well as the
Swiss Federal Council, took up the question afresh. These
endeavours at last took tangible shape in the first International
Conference for the protection of workers held in Berlin in
March 1890. This date remains a landmark in the history
of the subject, but not until ten years later—1900—did the
Congress held in Paris for the international legal protection of
workers lead to the establishment of what had been repeatedly
urged, namely, creation of an International Bureau. This
was inaugurated at Basle in 1901 and forms the headquarters
of the National Associations for Labour Legislation called into
being in various countries.</p>

<p>This International Association meets regularly in conference,
as in Cologne (1902), Berne (1905), Lucerne (1908), Lugano
(1910), and Zurich (1912). The questions raised in the International
Labour Bureau, which receives financial aid from a
number of States, are fully and scientifically discussed with the
object of finding a basis on which to bring into agreement the
divergent laws of the different countries. A further task of
this strictly scientific institution is the collection and publication
of literature bearing on the protection of workers in one
and another country, distribution of information, and the
editing of reports and memoranda. The question of prevention
of industrial poisoning has always taken a foremost place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
programme of the International Association and in the agenda
of the International Labour Bureau. At its first meeting a
resolution was adopted advocating the prohibition of the
use of white phosphorus and white lead, and the Labour
Bureau in Basle was instructed to take the necessary
steps. Special, if not prohibitive, economical considerations
foreshadowed difficulties—all the greater because the matter
at issue concerned prohibition of articles playing a part in the
markets of the world. Just on that account international
treatment of such questions is necessary, since a peaceful and
orderly solution can only be arrived at on such lines. International
effort endeavours here to press with equal weight on the
countries competing with one another commercially, so that in
the protection of the workers economic adjustment is sought
in order that efforts based on humanitarian grounds shall not
at the same time cause economic disadvantages, the aim being
to produce general welfare and not merely protection of one
class at the expense of another.</p>

<p>Through these international agreements between various
countries success in the direction aimed at is hopeful, and
indeed to a certain extent—as in the phosphorus and lead
questions—actually attained. Thus, for example, Germany
and Italy were in a position to enforce prohibition of the use
of white phosphorus early, while their neighbour Austria, on
account of commercial and political considerations and the
conditions of the home lucifer match industry, has only
recently decided on prohibition.</p>

<p>As international agreement for the protection of workers is
advisable on economic grounds, so also is it reasonable and
just from purely humanitarian reasons that workers, without
reference to civil condition or nationality, should be equally
protected. On this point it is proposed to take a vote and to
press only for those reforms which are thoroughly sound and
recognised as necessary.</p>

<p>The first step in such a comprehensive attack is precise knowledge
of the extent and source of origin of the particular forms
of industrial poisoning and disease and the collection of reliable
statistics. This suggested the obligation to notify such cases
to the proper authorities in the same way as is now done in
the case of infectious disease. A motion to this effect had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
already been passed at the Conference of the International
Association for Labour Legislation held in Basle, and a
request was made to the Labour Bureau to prepare a list
of the diseases and poisonings in question. To them we
shall refer later, but a schedule is necessary as a basis
to work upon. Yet even when this is done there are
obviously great difficulties to be overcome in carrying out
the requirement of notification when the aim is kept in
mind of collecting complete statistical data for controlling
the conditions giving rise to industrial disease. The proposal
of the International Association seeks to make notification
obligatory on the part both of the medical practitioner in
attendance and the occupier, and in connection with this to
secure the co-operation of the Sick Insurance Society.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> The
proposal to require the appointed surgeons and surgeons of the
Insurance Society to notify all cases is hardly feasible in view
of their dependent position. Nor can the obligation on the
occupiers lead to the desired result because of their lack of
medical knowledge and the fact that by notifying they might
be forced to act to their own disadvantage. A successful
effort in this direction is recorded in Saxony, where lead
poisoning was first made a notifiable disease, and later the
general duty of notification of industrial poisoning was prescribed
by Order dated March 4, 1901.</p>

<p>My own experience does not lead me to expect much in
elucidation of industrial diseases from the Sick Insurance
Societies. In Austria they make a statistical return as to
the causation of illness to the central authorities. I have
myself—in my capacity as an official of the State Central
Board—examined these in order to try and gain knowledge
of the extent of industrial disease in Bohemia. In spite of
the returns drawn up by the district surgeon who visits the
factories in question, it was impossible for me to obtain a complete
picture of the extent of industrial sickness. The reports
only give valuable data on which to base action in particular
cases, and from this standpoint I do not under-estimate their
value. But so far as the expressed wish of the International
Association is concerned they appear to fulfil it, inasmuch as
for specially dangerous trades special reports are issued, the
Austrian law for sick insurance requiring such industries to
institute separate sick insurance funds with separate statistics.
Hence, under present conditions, I do not see how the duty
of notification will be effective. There remains the endeavour
to secure insurance and the right to claim compensation for
industrial disease in the same way as is provided for accidents.
This point was fully discussed at the eighth International
Congress for Workmen’s Insurance held in Rome in 1908.
There is no valid ground for granting compensation only for
<i>sudden</i> disturbance of health arising in the course of employment
by accident or acute poisoning, and withholding it in the
case of <i>gradual</i> disturbance of health caused equally by the
trade, as the effects of such chronic indisposition weigh often no
less heavily on the sufferer. Inclusion of industrial disease in
the same category as accident insurance, as indeed has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
done in France, Switzerland and Great Britain, has, apart
from the fact that it is dictated by fairness and humanity, the
advantage of removing existing hardship and of solving
doubtful cases. Correct statistics, further, would thus be
obtainable for the first time, and the employer by insurance
would be freed from the legal proceedings now frequently
brought against him for injury due to chronic industrial
poisoning. And it seems the more right and just course to
institute a general scheme of insurance against industrial
disease than to have recourse to an Employer’s Liability Act
in this or that case, particularly as the question often arises
in regard to a disease which develops gradually—In whose
employment was the disease contracted?</p>

<p>Clearly in such a scheme of insurance against both accident
and industrial disease only specific industrial diseases would be
included, i.e. diseases in which the connection with the industry
can be clearly established as due to causes inherent in the
industry, and traceable to definite materials used. Such diseases
as tuberculosis and the effects of dust inhalation (bronchitis,
&amp;c.), which as industrial diseases occur only too often, cannot
be called specific, because they arise outside the industry and
make decision impossible as to whether or not in a particular
case the disease owed its origin to the occupation. In order to
determine what should be regarded as specific industrial poisons
it was deemed necessary to draw up a schedule. For one such
list Sommerfeld (in collaboration with Oliver and Putzeys) is
responsible, Carozzi of Milan for a second, and Fischer<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
third, published in 1910. Those by Sommerfeld and Fischer are
constructed in similar fashion—enumeration of (1) the poisonous
substance, (2) the industries in which it is made or used,
(3) the channel of absorption, and (4) the symptoms produced.
Sommerfeld enumerates the poisons in alphabetical order,
noting against each the requisite preventive measures, while
Fischer adopts a chemical classification, confining himself to
general introductory remarks as to prevention.</p>

<p>Sommerfeld proposes to limit notification to poisoning
sharply defined as to the symptoms set up, such as lead, phosphorus,
mercury, arsenic, chromium, carbonic oxide, aniline,
benzene, nitrobenzene, carbon bisulphide, and nitrous fumes.
This simplifies the obligation to notify, but does not dissipate
the fears expressed above as to the difficulty, because in the
present development of the chemical industries new substances
involving new danger to the persons handling them are constantly
being discovered, and thus there can be no finality as
to which industrial poisonings should entitle to compensation.
And if recourse were had from time to time to additions of new
substances to the schedule, reliance would have to be placed on
experience with regard to each substance added, and thus the
actual individual who had suffered would not benefit. Fischer,
indeed, acknowledges that any schedule must be incomplete,
and emphasises the fact that continual additions would be
necessary; otherwise it would be better to refrain altogether
from publication of a list. Such lists may be valuable guides,
but no sure foundation for insurance legislation. The only
possible way to do this is to give as far as possible a correct
definition of the industrial diseases entitling to compensation
and, in isolated cases, to leave the decision to the expert opinion
of competent judges.</p>

<p>Extension of workmen’s insurance to cover chronic
industrial poisoning is, however, most desirable in the interest
of employers and employed, and also of science. The German
accident insurance legislation is especially suited to do this,
since the trade organisations direct their attention not only to
the prevention of accidents but of industrial diseases also.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>SPECIAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR WORKERS</i></span></h3>

<h4>SELECTION, CHOICE OF TRADE, ALTERNATION OF EMPLOYMENT,
MEDICAL CONTROL, SAFETY APPLIANCES, INSTRUCTION AND
CO-OPERATION OF WORKERS, CLOTHING, ATTENTION TO
CLEANLINESS, FOOD, GENERAL WELFARE</h4>

<p>As a practical measure in protection against trade risk
selection of those capable of resisting danger has to be considered.
It is obviously desirable to select for employment
in a dangerous trade persons possessing powers of resistance,
because predisposition and resistance to the action of poisons
differ markedly in individuals. To some extent such a
selection comes of itself, as those who are very susceptible are
obliged by repeated attacks to give up the work. The social
and physical misery, undeserved loss of employment, illness,
and perhaps early death following on this kind of selection
might be checked by timely medical examination so as to weed
out the unfit. But medical examination prior to admission
into a dangerous trade (actually practised in many industries
involving risk of poisoning) inflicts hardship on those seeking
employment, and recruits the ranks of the unwillingly
unemployed. It would be much better were it possible to meet
the need of selection by pertinent direction and guidance in
choice of calling. There should be insistence in technical
schools especially on the dangers inherent in certain industries,
school medical examination as to physical qualifications for
certain industries, and careful note made of individual suitability
in labour bureaus, apprentice agencies, and the like.</p>

<p>Young female workers, naturally less able to resist, should
be excluded from work involving risk of poisoning—a principle
which has been acted on in the legislation of civilised
countries.</p>

<p>Further, workers engaged in industries involving risk
should not be exposed to the pernicious influence for too long a
time. Hence the hours of employment should be shortened in
occupations proved to be injurious to health. An important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
aid in this respect is alternation of employment. Change of
occupation is particularly recommended where the nature of
the poisoning of which there is risk is cumulative in action,
because in the intervals from the work the system will rid
itself of the accumulated store. In this way a number of
skilled resistant workers, familiar with the risk and knowing
how to meet it, will be maintained. Casual labour works in a
vicious circle—increase of fresh workers increases the danger
and the number of cases of poisoning, and, <i>vice versa</i>, these
augment again the need of change in the personnel, so that the
number of cases of poisoning rises very high. Thus the industry
itself may be endangered, since its prosperity depends mainly
upon the existence of a skilled staff of workers. In dangerous
trades, therefore, Hermann Weber’s words, ‘Change of work
instead of change of workers,’ have much force.</p>

<p>Periodical medical examination in these industries cannot
well be omitted in order to weed out the physically unfit, and
to suspend from work those who show early symptoms.
Note should be kept of the state of health of the workers, the
results of the periodical medical examination, the duration
of symptoms, and the treatment of any illness that occurs.
Medical supervision presupposes special training and experience
in the medical man entrusted with the task.</p>

<p>Further, in some industries in which poisonous materials
are used, especially such as set up acute sudden poisoning,
there should be a trained staff competent to recognise the first
symptoms of poisoning and to render first aid, and having at
its disposal adequate means of rescue.</p>

<p>Apart from the rescue appliances generally needed in
dangerous trades, stress must be laid on the value of oxygen
apparatus as a means of saving life. In addition to what
is needed for the sufferer there must be defensive apparatus at
hand for the rescuers (breathing helmets, &amp;c.), to facilitate
and make safe their rescue work when in a poisonous atmosphere.
Without such defensive equipment rescuers should
never venture into gas conduits, or into any place where
presumably a poisonous atmosphere is to be met with. It
hardly requires to be said that in dangerous industries medical
aid should be within easy reach; in large works actual medical
attendance may be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>In acute as well as in chronic cases of poisoning early medical
intervention is advisable. Hence medical aid should be sought
on the earliest appearance of symptoms, and the worker, therefore,
should know the nature and action of the poison with
which he comes into contact. This brings us to the subject
of the education of the worker and particularly observance
of all those rules and regulations in which his co-operation is
necessary. This co-operation of the workers is indispensable;
it is the most important condition of effective defence. The
best regulations and preventive measures are worthless if the
worker does not observe them. He must be taught their aim,
the way of using the means of defence; he must be admonished
to use them, and, if necessary, compelled to do so. The
co-operation of workmen’s organisations in this matter can
avail much, since a workman most readily follows the advice
of a fellow-worker.</p>

<p>Teaching of the kind suggested can be done in different
ways. Apart from lectures and practical courses, concise
instructions, either in the form of notices or as illustrated
placards, should be posted up in the workrooms or handed
in the form of leaflets particularly to the newly employed.
Distribution of such leaflets might well be placed as a duty
on the employer.</p>

<p>Of preventive measures applying to the individual those are
of prime importance which serve to protect the worker, as far
as is practicable, from coming into contact with the poison.
Protection of this kind is attained by wearing suitable
clothing, use of respirators, and careful cleanliness—especially
before partaking of food. It cannot be too strongly urged that
these precautions are a very potent defence against the danger
of industrial poisoning, especially of the chronic forms, and
in teaching workers their importance must be insisted on. It
is not sufficient merely to put on overalls over the ordinary
clothes. The ordinary clothes must be taken off before the
commencement of work, and working suits put on, to be taken
off again before the principal midday meal and before leaving
work. They should be made of smooth, durable, washable
material, and be properly washed and dried not less often than
once a week. They must be plainly cut without folds or pockets.</p>

<p>Direct handling of the poisonous substances is to be avoided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
but where this is necessary impervious gloves may have to be
worn, especially in the case of poisons which can be absorbed
through, or act injuriously on, the skin. If there is risk of
splashing or spilling of poisonous liquids on to the clothes,
impermeable or partly impermeable overalls (aprons, &amp;c.)
should be worn. The obligation of providing the overalls or
working suits falls naturally on the employer in industries
where poisonous substances are used, and there is equally
obligation on the employee to use the
articles provided.</p>

<p>Suitable cloakroom accommodation
is essential, by which is meant room not
only to change clothes with cupboards
or hooks on one side for clothing taken
off on commencement of work and on
the other the working suits, but also
ample washing accommodation. These
cupboards should be double, that is,
be divided by a partition into two
parts, one serving for the ordinary and
the other for the working clothes.</p>

Respirator</p>

</div>

<p>Protection of the respiratory organs
can to some extent be obtained by so-called
respirators worn over the mouth
and nose. Often they consist simply of a moist sponge or folds
of cloth, or again may be complicated air-proof affairs enclosing
mouth and nose, or the whole face like a mask, or even the head
like a helmet; they fit close, and the aperture for respired air
is provided with filtering material (cotton wool, &amp;c.) placed
between two layers of wire gauze. The outer layer of the
gauze moves on a hinge, so that the filtering material can be
renewed after each time that it has been used. The construction
of respirators is extraordinarily varied. One form is
illustrated. They must be light, and in order not to obstruct
breathing seriously they are often provided with valves—closing
during inspiration and opening during exhalation.
Generally the respirators in common use do not quite satisfactorily
fulfil the conditions required. After a time the
pressure becomes irksome, the face becomes hot, breathing
more difficult, and discomfort from wearing them unbearable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Respirators are only to be regarded in the light of secondary
aids and for occasional use.</p>

<p>During temporary exposure to an atmosphere charged
with poisonous dust the wearing of an efficient apparatus—preferably
one protecting the head—is very desirable.</p>

<p>Respirators afford no protection, or a very imperfect one,
against dangerous gases or fumes. If soaked with an absorbing
or neutralising fluid they can scarcely be worn for any length
of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>In an atmosphere charged with poisonous gas recourse
should be had either to a smoke helmet with flexible tubing and
bellows or to an oxygen breathing apparatus so constructed
that the workman carries the necessary supply of oxygen with
him in a knapsack on his back. In the latter case oxygen
from a compressed cylinder of the gas is conveyed to the
breathing mask, so that respiration is independent of the
surrounding atmosphere.</p>

pellets P, which free it of carbonic acid gas, so that, with a fresh
supply of oxygen from the cylinder through the pipe C, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
regenerated and made fit for breathing again. The pressure
in the cylinder is measured by a manometer, which indicates
also when the supply of oxygen gives out.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Another apparatus—the ‘Proto’ patent self-contained breathing
apparatus (Fleuss-Davis patents)—is also illustrated in <a href="#fig39">fig.
39</a>. <a href="#fig40">Illustration 40</a> gives a diagrammatic view of the principle
upon which it is designed. The instructions for using the
‘Proto’ apparatus are as follows:</p>

<p><i>The oxygen cylinders</i> (B, B), having been charged with
oxygen through the nipple at (H) to a pressure of 120 atmospheres
(about 1800 lbs. per square inch), are to be re-attached to the
belt as shown, and the reducing valve, with its tubes, &amp;c., is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
be connected to the nipple at (H). This supply is sufficient for
fully two hours.</p>

<p><i>Charging the breathing bag.</i>—Put 4 lbs. of stick caustic <i>soda</i>
into the bag (D), i.e. 2 lbs. into each compartment, and immediately
fasten the mouth of the bag by means of the clamps
and wing nuts (O). If the apparatus is not to be used at once,
but is to be hung up for use at some future time, the indiarubber
plug which is supplied with the apparatus should be tightly
fitted into the mouthpiece in order to prevent access of air to
the caustic soda, and to preserve it until required for use.</p>

<p>See that the inlet and outlet valves (T and S) and the connection
(N) are screwed up tightly.</p>

<p>The small relief valve (K) is only to be opened (by pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
it with the finger) when the bag becomes unduly inflated
through excess of oxygen. This may occur from time to time, as
the reducing valve is set to deliver more than the wearer actually
requires.</p>

<p><i>Equipment.</i>—The whole apparatus is supported upon a
broad belt which is strapped round the body. The bag is also
hung by a pair of shoulder braces.</p>

<p>The wearer having put the equipment over his shoulders,
fastens the belt and takes the plug out of the mouthpiece. The
moment the mouthpiece is put into the mouth or the mask is
adjusted, the main valve (H) is to be opened not more than
one turn and the necessary supply of oxygen will then flow into
the bag. It is advisable to open the by-pass (I) to inflate
partially the breathing bag (D) for a start, but this valve should
again be screwed up quite tight and not touched again, except
in the case of emergency as previously described should the bag
become deflated. Breathing will then go on comfortably.</p>

<p>Should the by-pass (I) on the reducing valve (C) get out of
order then the wearer should turn on the by-pass (I) from
time to time to give himself the necessary quantity of oxygen,
but, as stated above, this is only to be done in case of deflation
of the bag. The best guide as to the quantity of oxygen to
admit <i>in the above circumstances</i> is the degree of inflation of the
breathing bag. It will be found to be quite satisfactory if the
bag be kept moderately distended.</p>

<p><i>After using the apparatus.</i>—The caustic soda should <i>at once</i> be
thrown away, but if it is neglected and the soda becomes caked,
it must be dissolved out with warm water before putting in a
fresh supply. Caustic soda will not damage vulcanised indiarubber,
but it will damage canvas and leather, and will burn the
skin if allowed to remain upon it.</p>

<p>If the apparatus is to be used again at once, it can be recharged
with caustic soda at once, but if it is only to be charged
ready for use at some future time the indiarubber bag should
be thoroughly washed out with warm water and dried inside
with a cloth or towel.</p>

<p>When emptying or recharging the rubber bag with caustic
soda, it must always be removed from the canvas bag. After
use each day, it is advisable to wash the rubber mouthpiece
(or mask, as the case may be) with yellow soap and water. This
acts as a preservative to the indiarubber.</p>

<p>Every man who is to use the apparatus should have his own
mouthpiece and noseclip, or mask, as the case may be, under
his own special care, both for sanitary reasons and so that he
may shape and adjust the mask to fit himself comfortably and
air-tightly, to such an extent that if the outlets are stopped up
by the hands while the mask is held in position by its bands no
breath can pass in or out.</p>

<p>Where poisonous substances giving off dust or fumes are used,
regular washing and rinsing the mouth (especially before meals
and on leaving) is of great importance. Naturally the washing
conveniences (basins, soap, brushes, towels) must be sufficient
and suitable, and the workers instructed as to the importance
of cleanliness by the foreman. They should be urged to bath
in rotation, and time for it should be allowed during working
hours.</p>

<p>The taking of meals and use of tobacco in the workrooms
must be prohibited. Meal rooms should be so arranged as to be
contiguous to the cloakroom and washing accommodation, the
worker gaining access to the meal room through the cloakroom
and bathroom. The arrangement described is illustrated in
<a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>. The meal room serves also the purpose of a sitting-room
during intervals of work, and it goes without saying that
cloakroom and lavatory accommodation are as necessary in
small as in large premises.</p>

<p>Simple lavatory basins of smooth impervious surface fitted
with a waste pipe and plug, or tipping basins, are recommended
in preference to troughs which can be used by several persons
at once. Troughs, however, without a plug, and with jets of
warm water, are free from objection.</p>

<p>The douche bath has many advantages for workmen over
the slipper bath. The initial cost is comparatively small, so
that it can be placed at the disposal of the workers at very small
outlay. Maintenance and cleanliness of douche baths are
more easily secured than of other kinds, where changing the
water and keeping the bath in good order involve time and
expense. A dressing-room should form part of the douche
or slipper bath equipment. Walls and floors must be impervious
and, preferably, lined with smooth tiles or cement.
It is better that the shower bath should be under the control of
the worker by a chain rather than be set in motion by means of
mechanism when trodden upon. The arrangement of baths is
illustrated in <a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a>. In many large works large bath buildings
have been erected. <a href="#fig44a">Fig. 44</a> is a plan of the splendid bath
arrangements at the colour works of Messrs. Lucius, Meister

<p>Naturally maintenance of the general health by good
nourishing diet is one of the best means of defence against
onset of chronic industrial poisoning. Over and over again it
has been noticed that ill-fed workers speedily succumb to doses
of poison which well-nourished workers can resist. It is not
our province here to discuss fully the diet of a working-class
population. We merely state that it is a matter of vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
importance to those employed in dangerous trades. The
question of a suitable drink for workers to take the place of
alcohol calls for special attention, as, when complicated with
alcoholism, both acute and chronic poisonings entail more
serious results than they otherwise would do. Over-indulgence
in alcohol, owing to its effect on the kidneys, liver, digestion,
nervous system, and power of assimilation generally, requires
to be checked in every way possible. Apart from good drinking
water, milk, coffee, tea, fruit juices and the like, are excellent.
Milk is especially recommended, and should be supplied gratis
to workers in dangerous trades, notably where there is risk
of lead poisoning.</p>

<p>Lastly, other features such as games and exercise in the
open air, which help to strengthen bodily health, must not be
forgotten. In this connection much good work has already
been done by employers’ and workers’ organisations.</p>

<h3>IV<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>GENERAL REMARKS ON PREVENTIVE MEASURES</i></span></h3>

<h4>GENERAL PRINCIPLES, SUBSTITUTES FOR DANGEROUS MATERIALS,
CLEANLINESS OF WORKROOMS, CUBIC SPACE, VENTILATION,
REMOVAL OF DUST AND FUMES</h4>

<p>Preventive measures against industrial poisoning aim at
an unattainable goal of so arranging industrial processes that
employment of poisonous substances would be wholly avoided.
Such an ideal must be aimed at wherever practicable. Prohibition
of direct handling of poisonous substances is also
sometimes demanded, which presupposes (although it is not
always the case) that this is unnecessary or can be made unnecessary
by suitable mechanical appliances. We have to be
contented, therefore, for the most part, with removal of injurious
dust and fumes as quickly as possible at the point
where they are produced, and regulations for the protection
of workers from industrial poisoning deal mainly with the
question of the prevention of air contamination and removal of
contaminated air. Substitution of non-injurious for injurious
processes is only possible in so far as use of the harmless process
gives technically as good results as the other. If such a substitute
can be found let it be striven for. Mention has already
been made of international prohibition of certain substances,
and attention has been drawn to economical considerations
affecting this point.</p>

<p>Prohibition obviously may paralyse branches of industry
and hit heavily both employers and employed. The skilled
trained workers are just the ones to suffer, since they are no
longer in a position to take up another equally remunerative
trade.</p>

<p>Judgment has to be exercised before enforcing new regulations
in order that good and not harm may follow. If a
satisfactory substitute be discovered for methods of work
injurious to health, then ways and means will be found to
make the alteration in the process economically possible. It
may, however, demand sacrifice on the part of employers and
employed, but the progress is worth the sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are instances of substitution of safe processes
for those involving risk: generation of dust can sometimes be
avoided by a ‘wet’ method (watering of white lead chambers,
grinding pulp lead with oil, damping of smelting mixtures, &amp;c.);
the nitrate of silver and ammonia process has replaced the tin
and mercury amalgam used in silvering of mirrors; electroplating
instead of water gilding (coating objects with mercury
amalgam and subsequently volatilising the mercury); enamelling
with leadless instead of lead enamels; use of air instead
of mercury pumps in producing the vacuum in incandescent
electric lamps.</p>

<p>Dealing further with the sanitation of the factory and workshop
after personal cleanliness, the next most important measure
is cleanliness of the workroom and purity of the air. Workrooms
should be light and lofty; and have floors constructed of smooth
impervious material easily kept clean. The walls should be
lime-washed or painted with a white oil paint. Angles and
corners which can harbour dirt should be rounded. Cleansing
requires to be done as carefully and as often as possible, preferably
by washing down or by a vacuum cleaner. Saturation
of the floor with dust oil is recommended by some authorities
in trades where poisonous dust is developed and is permitted
as an alternative to the methods described. I refrain from
expressing an opinion on this method of laying dust, since by
adoption of the practice insistence on the need for removal of
the poisonous material from the workrooms loses its force—a
thing, in my opinion, to be deprecated.</p>

<p>The necessity of keeping the atmosphere of workrooms
pure and fresh makes it essential that there should be sufficient
cubic space per person and that proper circulation of the air
should be maintained. The minimum amount of cubic space
legally fixed in many countries—10-15 cubic metres—is a
minimum and should be greatly exceeded where possible.
Natural ventilation which is dependent upon windows,
porosity of building materials, cracks in the floors, &amp;c.,
fails when, as is desirable for purposes of cleanliness, walls
and floors are made of smooth impermeable material, and
natural ventilation will rarely supply the requisite cubic feet
of fresh air quickly enough. Ordinarily, under conditions
of natural ventilation, the air in a workroom is renewed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
from one to two hours. Artificial ventilation therefore becomes
imperative. Natural ventilation by opening windows and doors
can only be practised in intervals of work and as a rule only
in small workrooms. During work time the draught and
reduction of temperature so caused produce discomfort.</p>

<p><i>Artificial ventilation</i> is effected
by special openings and ducts
placed at some suitable spot in the
room to be ventilated and arranged
so that either fresh air is introduced
or air extracted from the
room. The first method is called
propulsion, the latter exhaust ventilation.
Various agencies will produce
a draught in the ventilating
ducts, namely, difference of temperature
between the outside and
inside air, which can be artificially
strengthened (<i>a</i>) by utilising the
action of the wind, (<i>b</i>) by heating
the air in the exhaust duct, (<i>c</i>) by
heating apparatus, and (<i>d</i>) by
mechanical power (use of fans).</p>

<p>Where advantage is taken of
the action of the wind the exit
to the ventilating duct must be
fitted with a cowl.</p>

<p>The draught in pipes is materially
increased if they are led
into furnace flues or chimneys; in
certain cases there is advantage
in constructing perpendicular
ventilating shafts in the building
extending above the roof and fitted
with cowls. Combination of heating and ventilation is very
effective.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span>—Steam Injector (<i>after
Körting</i>), showing steam injector
and air entry</p>

</div>

<p>In workrooms, however, where there is danger of poisoning
by far the most effective method of ventilation is by means of
fans driven by mechanical power. All the means for securing
artificial ventilation hitherto mentioned depend on a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
factors (wind, difference of temperature, &amp;c.), the influence of
which is not always in the direction desired. Exact regulation,
however, is possible by fans, and the quantity of air introduced
or extracted can be accurately calculated beforehand
in planning the ventilation. In drawing up such a plan,
detailing the arrangement, proportions of the main and branch
ducts, expenditure of power, &amp;c., a ventilating engineer should
be consulted, as it is his business to deal with complicated
problems of ventilation depending
entirely for success on the design
of the ventilation.</p>

<p>Injectors are usually only employed
for special technical or
economical reasons. A jet of
steam or compressed air which
acts on the injector creates a
partial vacuum and so produces
a powerful exhaust behind. <a href="#fig45">Fig.
45</a> shows the mechanism of
an injector. They are used for
exhausting acid fumes which
would corrode metal fans and
pipes, and for explosive dust
mixtures where fans are inadmissible.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>—Propeller Fan coupled
to Electromotor (<i>Davidson &amp;
Co., Ltd.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>In the industries described in this book fans are most
commonly used. These are, in the main, wheels with two
or more wing-shaped flattened blades. Some are encased,
others are open and fitted by means of annular frames in the
ducts according to the intended effect and kind of fan. Fans are
of two kinds, propeller and centrifugal, and, according to the
pressure they exert, of low, medium, or high pressure. They
are now often driven electrically, in which case there is advantage
in coupling them directly with the motor.</p>

<p><i>Propeller fans</i> have curved screw-shaped blades and are
set at right angles in the duct upon the column of air in which
they act by suction. The air is moved in the direction of the
axis of the fan, and generally it is possible, by reversing the
action, to force air in instead of extracting it. The draught
produced is a low-pressure one (generally less than 15 mm. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
water). The current of air set in motion travels at a relatively
slow speed, yet such fans are capable, when suitably proportioned,
of moving large volumes of air. Propeller fans are
specially suitable for the general ventilation of rooms when
the necessary change of air is not being effected by natural
means.</p>

<p><i>Centrifugal</i> or <i>high-pressure fans</i> (see figs. <a href="#fig48a">48<span class="smcap">a</span></a> and <a href="#fig48b">48<span class="smcap">b</span></a> ) are
always encased in such a way that the exhaust ducts enter
on one or both sides of the axis. The air thus drawn in is
thrown by the quickly rotating numerous straight blades to
the periphery and escapes at the outlet. The centrifugal fan
travels at a great speed, and the air current has therefore great
velocity and high pressure. When the pressure is less than
120 mm. it is described as a medium, and when greater, a high-pressure
fan. For the former a galvanised iron casing suffices;
for the latter the casing requires to be of cast iron. Medium
pressure centrifugal fans are used to exhaust dust or fumes
locally from the point at which they are produced. They
play a great part in industrial hygiene.</p>

<p>High-pressure fans are used mainly for technical purposes,
as, for example, the driving of air or gas at high pressure.
Localised ventilation is needed to limit diffusion of dust
and fumes, which is attained in a measure also by separation
of those workrooms in which persons come into contact
with poisonous materials from others. Separation of workrooms,
however, is not enough, as it is the individual who
manipulates the poison for whom protection is desired. To
enclose or hood over a dusty machine or fume-producing
apparatus completely, or to close hermetically a whole series
of operations by complicated technical arrangements, is only
possible when no opening or hand feeding is required.
Dangerous substances can only be wholly shut in by substitution
of machinery for handwork.</p>

<p>Where, however, absolute contact is unavoidable the dust
or fume must be carried away at its source. This is done by
exhaust ventilation, locally applied, in the following manner:
A suitable hood or air guide of metal or wood is arranged
over the point where the dust is produced, leaving as small an
opening as possible for necessary manipulations. The hood
is connected with a duct through which the current of air
travels. An exhaust current dependent upon heat will only
suffice in the case of slight development of dust or fumes.
As a rule exhaust by a fan is necessary. Where exhaust
ventilation has to be arranged at several points all these are
connected up by branch ducts with the main duct and centrifugal
fan. Where the ducts lie near the floor it is advisable
to fix adjustable openings in them close to the floor to remove
the sweepings.</p>

</div>

<p>It is important for the exhaust system of ventilation to be
designed in general so that the dust is drawn away from the
face of the worker downwards and backwards. Many horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
arrangements are found in which the dust is first aspirated past
the mouth and nose before it is drawn into a hood overhead.
The proportions of the branch pipes to the main duct require to
be thought out, and friction and resistance to the flow must be
reduced as far as possible by avoidance of sharp bends. Branch
pipes should enter the main duct at an angle of thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
degrees. A completely satisfactory system requires very special
knowledge and often much ingenuity when the apparatus is
complicated.</p>

<p>Disintegrators and edge runners can generally be covered in
and the cover connected with an exhaust. Ball mills, when
possible, are best as the rotating iron cylinder containing the
steel balls and the material to be pulverised is hermetically
closed.</p>

<p>Powdered material can be carried mechanically from one
place to another by worms, screws, endless bands, or be driven
in closed pipes by means of compressed air. The inevitable
production of dust in packing can be avoided by the use of
ventilated packing machines, which are especially necessary
in the case of white lead, bichromates, basic slag, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The difficulty is great in preventing dust in sieving and
mixing, since this is mainly done by hand. Still here, for
example, by use of cases with arm-holes and upper glass cover,
injury to health can be minimised. Benches with a wire screen
and duct through which a downward exhaust passes are useful
in sorting operations (<a href="#fig52">fig. 52</a>).</p>

<p>To prevent escape of injurious gases all stills and furnaces
must be kept as airtight as possible and preferably under a
slight negative pressure. Agitators must be enclosed and
should be fitted with arrangements for carrying on the work
mechanically or by means of compressed air and, if necessary,
exhaust ventilation applied to them. The aim should be to
enclose entirely drying and extracting apparatus.</p>

<p>An important question remains as to what shall be done with
the dust and fumes extracted. In many cases they cannot
be allowed to escape into the atmosphere outside, and in the
interests of economy recovery and utilisation of the waste
is the thing to aim at. This vital subject can only receive
barest mention here. The dust or fumes extracted require
to be subjected to processes of purification with a view to
recovery of the often valuable solid or gaseous constituents
and destruction of those without value.</p>

<p>Collection of dust may take place in settling chambers as
in a cyclone separator in which the air to be purified is made
to travel round the interior of a cone-shaped metal receptacle,
depositing the dust in its passage (<a href="#fig54">see fig. 54</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The most effective method, however, is filtration of the
air through bags of canvas or other suitable fabric as in the
‘Beth’ filter (see figs. <a href="#fig55">55</a> and <a href="#fig56">56</a>). In the ‘Beth’ filter a
mechanical knocking apparatus shakes the dust from the
bag to the bottom of the casing, where a worm automatically
carries it to the collecting receptacle. In the absence of
mechanical knocking the filtering material becomes clogged
and increases the resistance in the system. Contrivances of
the kind unintelligently constructed become a source of
danger to the workers. Dust of no value is usually precipitated
by being made to pass through a tower down which
a fine spray of water falls. If the gases and fumes can be
utilised they are either absorbed or condensed—a procedure
of the utmost importance for the protection of the workers.</p>

<p>Condensation of the gases into a liquid is effected by
cooling and is an essential part of all processes associated
with distillation. The necessary cooling is effected either
by causing the vapours to circulate through coils of pipes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
surrounded by cold water or by an increase in the condensing
surface (extension of walls, &amp;c.), and artificial cooling of the
walls by running water.</p>

<p>Absorption of gases and fumes by fluids (less often by
solid substances) is effected by bubbling the gas through
vessels filled with the absorbing liquid or conducting it through
towers (packed with coke, flints, &amp;c.), or chambers down or
through which the absorbent flows. Such absorption towers
and chambers are frequently placed in series.</p>

<p>The material thus recovered by condensation and absorption
may prove to be a valuable bye-product. Frequently the
gases (as in blast furnace gas, coke ovens, &amp;c.) are led away
directly for heating boilers, or, as in the spelter manufacture,
to make sulphuric acid.</p>

<h3 id="PARTICULAR_INDUSTRIES">V<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>PREVENTIVE REGULATIONS FOR CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES</i></span></h3>

<h4>Sulphuric Acid Industry</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_4">4-14</a> and <a href="#Page_171">171</a>)</p>

<p>Danger arises from escape of acid gases or in entering
chambers, towers, containers, &amp;c., for cleaning purposes.
The whole chamber system, therefore, requires to be impervious
and the sulphur dioxide and nitrous gases utilised to
their fullest extent—a procedure that is in harmony with
economy in production. The pyrites furnace must be so
fired as to prevent escape of fumes, which is best attained by
maintenance of a slight negative pressure by means of fans.
The cinders raked out of the furnace because of the considerable
amount of sulphur dioxide given off from them should
be kept in a covered-in place until they have cooled. Any
work on the towers and lead chambers, especially cleaning
operations, should be carried out under strict regulations. Such
special measures for the emptying of Gay-Lussac towers have
been drawn up by the Union of Chemical Industry. Before
removal of the sediment on the floor they require a thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
drenching with water, to be repeated if gases are present.
Perfect working of the Gay-Lussac tower at the end of the
series of chambers is essential to prevent escape of acid gases.
In a well-regulated sulphuric acid factory the average total
acid content of the final gases can be reduced to 0·1 vol. per
cent. Under the Alkali Works Regulation Act of 1881 the
quantity was limited to 0·26 per cent. of sulphur dioxide—and
this should be a maximum limit.</p>

<p><i>Entering and cleaning out chambers and towers</i> should only
be done, if practicable, by workmen equipped with breathing
apparatus, and never without special precautionary measures,
as several fatalities have occurred at the work. Towers,
therefore, are best arranged so as to allow of cleaning from the
outside; if gases are noticed smoke helmets should be donned.
The same holds good for entering tanks or tank waggons.
After several cases of poisoning from this source had occurred
in a factory the following official regulations were issued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The deposit on the floor of waggons or tanks shall be
removed either by flushing with water without entering the
tank itself, or if the tank be entered the deposit is to be
scooped out without addition of water or dilute soda solution.</p>

<p>Flushing out shall only be done after the workmen have
got out.</p>

<p>Workmen are to be warned every time cleaning is undertaken
that poisonous gases are developed when the deposit
on the floor is diluted.</p>

<p>Acid eggs, further, are to be provided with a waste pipe
and manhole to enable cleaning to be done from outside.</p>

</div>

<p>The poisoning likely to arise is partly due to arsenic impurity
(development of arseniuretted hydrogen gas) in the sulphuric
acid used. Unfortunately arsenic free acid is very difficult to
obtain.</p>

<h4>Hydrochloric Acid—Saltcake and Soda Industries</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_15">15-23</a> and <a href="#Page_170">170</a>)</p>

<p>Preventive measures here depend upon observance of
the general principles already discussed.</p>

<p>The <i>saltcake pan</i> and reverberatory furnace require to be
accurately and solidly constructed and the process carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
regulated. Regulations indeed were drawn up at an early
date in England as to their working to prevent escape of
gases when adding the acid, raking over in the reverberatory
furnace, and withdrawal of the still fuming saltcake.</p>

<p>The following are the most important of these recommendations:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The saltcake pan must not be charged when overheated.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid shall be added only after all the salt has
been charged and the door shut.</p>

<p>If hydrochloric acid fumes escape at the door when the
Glover acid flows in the flow must be interrupted.</p>

<p>All doors must be closed while work is in progress.</p>

<p>Definite times shall be fixed for withdrawal of the saltcake
in order to try and ensure that it be not still fuming, but
should this be the case cold sulphate of soda shall be
sprinkled over it.</p>

</div>

<p>The general principle should be observed of maintaining
a slight negative pressure in the furnace by insertion of a fan
in the gas conduit so as to avoid possible escape of gas. The
fuming saltcake is best dealt with by depositing it at once to
cool in ventilated receptacles or chambers.</p>

<p>On grounds of economy and hygiene as complete an
absorption as possible of the hydrochloric acid gas developed
in the saltcake and soda ash process is to be aimed at,
by conveying it through impervious conduits to the
bombonnes and lofty absorption tower filled with coke or
flints down which water trickles. The entire loss of hydrochloric
acid should not amount to more than 1·5 per cent. of
the whole. Under the Alkali Act at first 5 per cent. was
allowed, but this is excessive now in view of improved methods
of condensation.</p>

<p>In the <i>Leblanc</i> process the revolving furnace is on health
grounds to be preferred to the hand furnace. Such a furnace
occupies the space of but three hand furnaces and can
replace eighteen of them. The vast accumulation of waste,
consisting mainly of calcium sulphide, and generating sulphuretted
hydrogen gas in such amount as to constitute a
nuisance, is only partially prevented by the Chance-Claus
and other methods of recovery, and makes it most desirable
to adopt the Solvay ammonia process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—<i>Sulphonal, Oxalic acid, Ultramarine, Alum.</i>—The
production of <i>sulphonal</i> is intensely unpleasant owing to the
disagreeable smell (like cats’ excrement) of the mercaptan
developed. All work therefore must be carried on in air-tight
apparatus under negative pressure and careful cooling. Any
escaping fumes must be absorbed in solution of acetone and
fine water spray.</p>

<p>Preparation of <i>oxalic acid</i> unless carried on in closed-in
vessels gives rise to injurious and troublesome fumes. If
open pans are used, hoods and ducts in connection with a fan
should be placed over them.</p>

<p>Grinding of <i>ultramarine</i> and <i>alum</i> requires to be done in
closed-in mills, and any dust drawn away by locally applied
ventilation and filtered. The gases given off in the burning
process contain 3 per cent. of sulphur dioxide, which requires
to be absorbed—a procedure most easily effected in towers
where the upstreaming gas comes into contact with a dilute
solution of lime or soda.</p>

<h4>Chlorine, Bleaching Powder, Chlorine Compounds</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_23">23-9</a> and <a href="#Page_173">173</a>)</p>

<p>What has been said as to imperviousness of apparatus,
negative pressure maintained by the tall chimney stack or
earthenware or fireclay fan, &amp;c., applies equally here. The
exhaust ventilation is also required to aspirate the gas into
the bleaching chambers.</p>

<p>At the end of the system there must be either a tower
packed with quicklime to absorb the last traces of chlorine or
such a number of bleach chambers into which the gas can
be led that no chlorine escapes. Production of chlorine gas
electrolytically is to be preferred to other processes on hygienic
grounds.</p>

<p>Careful cleanliness is the best prophylactic against occurrence
of <i>chlorine rash</i> among persons employed in the electrolytic
production of chlorine. In some factories attempt has
been made to use other substances (magnetite) instead of
carbon for the anode, and the success attending their adoption
is further proof that the tar cement at the anode helped to
cause the acne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Weldon</i> process care must be taken that the water
lutes are intact, and the stills must not be opened before
the chlorine has been drawn off. All processes in which
manganese dust can arise (grinding of manganese dioxide
and drying of Weldon deposit) should be done under locally
applied exhaust. The <i>bleaching powder</i> chambers must be
impervious and care taken that they are not entered before
the chlorine has been absorbed. Usually the number of lime
chambers connected up with each other is such that no chlorine
escapes free into the air. Emptying of the finished product
should not be done by hand, as considerable quantities of
chlorine escape and make the work extremely irksome.
Mechanical methods of emptying should be adopted in substitution
for hand labour, and of these the Hasenclever closed-in
apparatus is the best.</p>

<h4>Nitric Acid and Explosives</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_39">39-49</a> and <a href="#Page_172">172</a>)</p>

<p>In the production of <i>nitric acid</i> complete imperviousness of
the system and as complete condensation of the gases as
possible by means of tourilles, cooling condensers, and the
requisite number of towers are necessary. The method
suggested by Valentine of manufacture of nitric acid in
apparatus under a partial vacuum has advantages from a
hygienic standpoint. Earthenware fans are used to force
the nitric acid gases onwards and have the advantage of
creating a negative pressure. Great care is needed in
handling, emptying, packing, conveying, and storing the
acid in consequence of the danger from breaking or spilling.
The bottles used must be in perfect condition and must be well
packed. No greater stock of nitric acid should be allowed
in a room than is absolutely necessary, and care must be
exercised in the event of a carboy breaking that the spilt acid
does not come into contact with organic substances, as that
would increase development of nitrous fumes.</p>

<p>Workers must be warned not to remain in rooms in which
acid has been spilt. They are only to be entered by workers
equipped with breathing apparatus (smoke helmets).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the special regulations on the subject may be
mentioned those of the Prussian Ministerial Decree, dated
January 8, 1900, concerning nitrous fumes and means of
protection for workers employed with the acid. What has
been said on p. <a href="#Page_257">257</a> in regard to the transport of sulphuric
acid applies equally to nitric acid.</p>

<p>In the <i>nitrating</i> process in the manufacture of explosives
(see p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>) it is essential that the apparatus is hermetically
closed, that agitation is done mechanically, or better still
by means of compressed air, and that any fumes developed
are exhausted and condensed. In the preparation of <i>nitro-glycerin</i>
(see p. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>) the gases developed in the nitration of
the waste acid require to be carefully condensed. Contact
of nitro-glycerin with the skin has to be avoided and the
attention of the workers drawn to the danger. Preparation
of <i>gun cotton</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>) takes place in machines which are
at the same time nitrating and centrifugalising machines.
The apparatus is first filled with the nitrating acid and the
cotton added; the fumes are drawn off by earthenware
ducts and fans, and lastly the bulk of the acid is removed by
centrifugal action. Such machines carry out effectually the
principles of industrial hygiene.</p>

<p>In the preparation of <i>fulminate of mercury</i> nitrous fumes,
cyanogen compounds, and acetic acid compounds are developed
by the action of the nitric acid on mercury, and require to
be dealt with by exhaust ventilation.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<h4>Artificial Manures, Fertilizers</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_53">53</a> and <a href="#Page_54">54</a>)</p>

<p>In grinding phosphorite and superphosphates, corrosive
dust is produced. All grinding operations must, therefore, be
carried out automatically in closed apparatus (ball mills,
disintegrators, &amp;c.). In making the phosphorite soluble by
treatment with sulphuric acid, and subsequent drying of the
product, corrosive hydrofluoric acid gas is developed, which
requires to be carried away by an acid proof exhaust fan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
condensed in a tower by water (<a href="#fig58">see fig. 58</a>). The modern
revolving drying machines are especially serviceable.</p>

<p>In the production of <i>basic slag</i> corrosive dust is given off,
causing ulceration of the mucous membrane. Grinding and
other manipulations creating dust must be carried on in
apparatus under local exhaust ventilation. The following—somewhat

<h4>Preparation of Hydrofluoric Acid</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_37">37</a> and <a href="#Page_171">171</a>)</p>

<p>The fumes given off in the preparation of hydrofluoric acid
require to be collected in leaden coolers and vessels; that
which escapes requires to be absorbed by a water spray in
towers. The apparatus must be impervious and kept under a
slight negative pressure.</p>

<h4>Chromium Compounds</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_55">55-8</a> and <a href="#Page_185">185</a>)</p>

<p>The German Imperial Decree, dated May 16, 1907, contains
the preventive measures necessary in bichromate factories.
According to this, workers suffering from ulceration of the
skin (chrome holes, eczema) are not to be employed except
on a medical certificate that they are free from such affections,
and daily examination for signs of ulceration is enjoined, so
that those affected may receive prompt treatment. Further,
periodical medical examination of the workers is required at
monthly intervals. Respirators (for work in which dust cannot
be avoided), with lavatory, cloakroom, and meal room accommodation,
are to be provided, and also baths. In handling
bichromates wearing of impervious gloves may be necessary,
and smearing the hands and face with vaseline is recommended.
In addition diffusion of dust and fumes must be minimised;
machines in which mixing, crushing, and grinding are done
must be impervious, and provided with exhaust ventilation.
Charging of the furnaces, where possible, should be effected
mechanically and the fumes developed both in manipulation
of the furnaces and from hot bichromate liquor removed by
an exhaust.</p>

<p>A leaflet containing directions for workers coming into
contact with chromium compounds in chemical factories,
dyeing, tanning, wood staining, calico printing, wall paper
printing, painting, &amp;c., has been drawn up by Lewin. It
contains a list of the poisonous chrome compounds and of the
industries in which chrome poisoning occurs, information as to
the action of chrome upon the skin and mucous membrane, and
the preventive measures necessary. Among the last named are:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
smearing the skin with oil, use of impervious gloves, respirators
in work where dust arises, necessity of cleanliness, and periodical
medical examination.</p>

<p>For the <i>chrome tanning industry</i> the following leaflet was
drawn up by the Imperial Health Office in Berlin, which
succinctly states the measures against chrome poisoning in
these industries and contains much practical information
for the workers:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In chrome tanning by the two bath process, the first bath
containing potassium bichromate and hydrochloric acid has a
corroding effect upon broken surfaces of the skin (scratches,
chapped hands, eruptions, &amp;c.). In consequence, they develop
into round ulcers (chrome holes) with hard raised edges which
are difficult to heal and go on increasing in size unless work at
the process is temporarily given up. In persons with very
sensitive skin, even though the surface may be intact, handling
the liquor brings on sometimes an obstinate rash (eczema) on
the hands and forearms.</p>

<p>The solution used in the one bath process has no corrosive
action, but it is a strong poison, just as is the solution of
potassium bichromate of the two bath process. If swallowed,
the solutions cause vomiting, diarrhœa, kidney trouble, and
even death. Chromium compounds can also enter the body
through skin wounds and cause illness.</p>

<p><i>Prevention.</i>—In order to prevent the occurrence of chrome
ulceration, workers employed with chrome or chrome solutions
must be especially careful in avoiding injury to the skin of the
hands or forearms. This applies especially to workers who
carry the vessels containing bichromate, who weigh and dissolve
the potassium bichromate, or who come into contact with the
tanning liquor or with undressed skins and hides which have
lain in the liquor.</p>

<p>If, in spite of precautions, eruptions, rashes, or ulceration
occur, all work necessitating contact with corrosive tanning
liquors should be suspended until they are healed.</p>

<p>In order to reduce risk of action of the liquor on the skin,
workers employed in the process described would do well if,
before commencing work, they carefully smeared hands and
forearms with unsalted lard, vaseline, or the like, and during
work avoided, as much as possible, soiling the bare hands and
arms with the liquor.</p>

<p>If, nevertheless, a worker has contracted a chrome hole, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
eruption, he should consult a medical man, informing him at
the same time of the nature of his work.</p>

<p>To avoid internal absorption of chrome, workers preparing
the baths must carefully avoid inhaling the dust of chromium
salts. These and all other workers engaged with the liquors containing
chromium must not take food and drink while at work.
Working suits should be taken off and face and hands washed
with soap before eating or drinking, and before leaving the
factory.</p>

</div>

<h4>Petroleum, Benzine</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_59">59-64</a> and <a href="#Page_222">222-4</a>)</p>

<p>As crude petroleum and the higher fractions first distilled
from it affect the skin injuriously, wetting the skin should be
avoided, and careful cleanliness on the part of the workers
enjoined. Workers exposed to the influence of gases escaping
from naphtha springs and wells should be equipped with
breathing apparatus (smoke helmets); this applies to those
who have to enter stills and other apparatus connected with
the distillation of petroleum.</p>

<p>In the preparation of petroleum by sulphuric acid
sulphur dioxide in great quantity is developed, constituting
a distinct danger to the workers. This process, therefore,
should be carried on in closed vessels furnished with mechanical
stirrers or compressed air agitators. The most suitable
apparatus is that illustrated in <a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>Petroleum tanks must be thoroughly aired before they are
cleaned and should be entered only by workers equipped with
breathing apparatus. Apparatus containing petroleum and
benzine requires, as far as possible, to be closed in and air tight
(as, for example, in the extraction of fat from bones and oil
seed, in the rubber industry, and in chemical cleaning establishments);
where benzine fumes develop they should be immediately
drawn away by suitably applied exhaust ventilation.
This is necessary, on account of the danger of fire, in chemical
cleaning establishments where purification is effected by means
of benzine in closed drums.</p>

<p>Regulations for benzine extraction plants are contained in
the Prussian Ministerial Decree, dated January 5, 1909, for
benzine extraction works, and also in that of August 3, 1903,
for dry-cleaning premises, to which last were added ‘Directions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
for safety,’ containing important regulations as to risk from
fire. From our standpoint the following points are of interest:
care is to be taken to provide and maintain exhaust ventilation
directly across the floor. The air, however, must not be
allowed to pass near any fire. Drying rooms especially are to
be lofty and airy, and separated from other workrooms. In
factories with mechanical power the authorities may require
provision of artificial ventilation for the drying rooms. Washing
machines, centrifugalising machines, and benzine rinsing
vessels should be furnished with well-fitting covers to be
removed only for such time as is absolutely necessary for
putting in and taking out the articles to be cleaned, shaken, or
rinsed. The vessels named are to be examined as to their
imperviousness at least once every quarter by a properly
qualified person. The condition in which they are found is
to be noted in a book to be shown to the Factory Inspector
and police authorities on demand.</p>

<p>Lastly, substitution for benzine of other less poisonous
substances such as carbon tetrachloride has been urged.</p>

<h4>Phosphorus, Lucifer Matches</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_49">49-53</a> and <a href="#Page_190">190</a>)</p>

<p>In view of the danger of the lucifer match industry,
measures were taken at an early date in almost all civilised
states to guard against phosphorus poisoning, and in many
countries have led to the prohibition of the use of white
phosphorus. Complete prohibition of its manufacture and use
was first enacted in Finland (1872) and in Denmark (1874).
Prohibition was decreed in Switzerland in 1879 (in January
1882 this was revoked, but again enacted in 1893), and in the
Netherlands in 1901. In Germany the law prohibiting the use
of white phosphorus came into force in January 1908, and
runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. White or yellow phosphorus shall not be employed in the
production of matches and other lighting substances. Lighting
substances made with white phosphorus shall not be kept for
sale, or sold, or otherwise brought on the market. Provided
that this shall not apply to ignition strips which serve for the
lighting of safety lamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Persons wilfully infringing this law shall be punished by
a fine of 2000 marks. If the infringement occurs through
ignorance the fine shall consist of 150 marks.</p>

<p>In addition to the fine, all prohibited articles produced,
imported, or brought into the trade shall be confiscated, as well
as the implements used in their production, without reference
to whether they belong to the person convicted or not. If
prosecution or conviction of the guilty party cannot be brought
home, confiscation nevertheless is to be carried out independently.</p>

</div>

<p>Roumania and France have a state monopoly of matches;
in these states no white phosphorus matches have been produced
since 1900 and 1898 respectively. France, by the Law
of December 17, 1908, signified concurrence with the International
Convention in regard to the prohibition of the use of
white phosphorus.</p>

<p>In Sweden and Norway the prohibition of white phosphorus
is in force only for the home trade. A Swedish Decree, dated
December 9, 1896, permitted factories carrying on the manufacture
for export to use white phosphorus, and almost precisely
similar provisions are contained in the Norwegian Decree.
The Swedish Decree, dated March 30, 1900, permits white
phosphorus matches to be exported, but not to be sold in the
country. In Austria difficulties in regard to prohibition of
white phosphorus arose owing to trade conditions (especially in
the East), and the attitude of the states competing in the lucifer
match trade, particularly Italy and Japan. Austria, therefore,
made agreement with international prohibition of white phosphorus,
dependent on the attitude of Japan; since Japan did
not concur, the decision of Austria fell through. When, however,
Italy in the year 1906 joined the Convention, the difficulties
were also overcome in Austria, and by a law similar to
that of Germany, dated July 13, 1909, prohibition of the
manufacture and sale of white phosphorus matches dates
from the year 1912.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>Belgium has refrained from prohibition of white phosphorus,
but on the other hand has passed a series of enactments relating
to the match manufacture, of which the most essential are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
here cited, since they characterise the measures which come
into consideration for factories in which white phosphorus is
still employed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Royal Decree, dated March 25, 1890, modified by the Royal
Decree, dated February 12, 1895, and November 17, 1902,
concerning employment in lucifer match factories.</i></p>

<p>1. In match factories where white phosphorus is used,
mixing the paste and drying the dipped matches shall be carried
on in a place specially set apart for the purpose.</p>

<p>2. Mixing the paste shall be carried on in an entirely closed
vessel or in one connected with an efficient exhaust draught
locally applied.</p>

<p>The proportion of white phosphorus in the paste shall not
exceed in weight 8 per cent. of the total material, not including
water.</p>

<p>3. Hoods and ducts communicating with an exhaust
draught shall be installed at the level of the plates for dipping
white phosphorus matches, and over the vessels containing
the paste.</p>

<p>4. Drying rooms for white phosphorus matches, if entered
by the workers, shall be mechanically ventilated.</p>

<p>5. Rooms in which phosphorus fumes can arise shall be
lofty and well ventilated, preferably by an exhaust at the
level of the work benches, communicating with the main
chimney stack.</p>

<p>The workrooms shall be kept clean. No food or drink
shall be taken in them.</p>

<p>6. In every match factory the workers shall have at their
disposal a special cloak room and suitable and sufficient washing
accommodation, so as to be able to change clothes before
commencing, and at the end of, work, and to wash the hands
and face on leaving.</p>

<p>Cleanliness will be obligatory upon the workers manipulating
phosphorus paste or matches.</p>

<p>7. Workers coming into contact with phosphorus paste or
matches shall be examined monthly by a surgeon appointed
by the Minister of Industry, who shall be paid by the occupier.</p>

<p>Workers having decayed, unstopped teeth, or exhibiting
symptoms of gingivitis or stomatitis, or in poor health at the
time of examination, shall be temporarily suspended from work.</p>

<p>The surgeon shall enter the results of his monthly examinations
in a prescribed register.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>This register shall be shown to the Factory Inspector on
demand.</p>

</div>

<p>These decrees are supplemented by further orders regarding
the taking of samples of paste in match factories and store
houses (Royal Orders of March 25, 1890; February 12, 1895;
April 18, 1898; November 17, 1902).</p>

<p>As is evident from the Belgian enactment, in states where
prohibition of white phosphorus is not in force, palliative
measures only are possible and even then they can only be
enforced in large factories when automatic machinery is used
to eliminate hand labour in dangerous operations. In this
respect the introduction of closed, ventilated, mechanical
mixing apparatus provided with mechanical stirrers, closed
and ventilated mechanical dipping and drying apparatus, are
especially important. Certain modern American machines
carry through the whole complicated process of the phosphorous
match industry automatically. Seeing that prohibition of
white phosphorus is an accomplished fact and that matches
free from risk in their manufacture answer every purpose,
the universal enforcement of the prohibition of white
phosphorus should be striven for in civilised states.</p>

<h4>Carbon bisulphide</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_68">68-71</a> and <a href="#Page_193">193-5</a>)</p>

<p>Use of carbon bisulphide in the vulcanising of indiarubber
goods by dipping them into the liquid and subsequently
drying them (usually in a current of hot air) causes
development of carbon bisulphide fumes in considerable
quantity, especially if the articles to be dried are laid on
shelves or hung up in the workroom, a procedure which should
never be permitted. Drying must be carried out under local
exhaust ventilation.</p>

<p>All vessels holding carbon bisulphide used for dipping can
be placed in a wooden channel above the dipping vessels, provided
with openings for manipulation, and connected with an
exhaust system.</p>

<p>The following are the German Imperial Regulations, dated
March 1, 1902, for vulcanising of indiarubber by means of
carbon bisulphide:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Vulcanising by Means of Carbon Bisulphide</span></p>

<p>(Notice concerning the erection and management of industrial
premises in which indiarubber goods are vulcanised by means
of carbon bisulphide or chloride of sulphur.)</p>

<p>The following regulations shall apply in accordance with
paragraph 120 (<i>e</i>) of the Industrial Code:</p>

<p>1. The floor of such rooms as are used for the vulcanising
of indiarubber goods by means of carbon bisulphide shall not
be lower than the surrounding ground. The rooms shall have
windows opening into the outer air, and the lower halves shall be
capable of being opened so as to render possible sufficient renewal
of air.</p>

<p>The rooms shall be ventilated by fans mechanically driven.
With the approval of the higher authorities permission to
dispense with mechanical draught may be allowed, provided
that in other ways powerful change of air is secured. With the
approval of the higher authorities special ventilating arrangements
can be dispensed with if the fumes of carbon bisulphide
are removed immediately, at the point where they are produced,
by means of a powerful draught, and in this way purity of the
air be secured.</p>

<p>2. The vulcanising rooms shall not be used as a dwelling, or
for sleeping in, or for preparing food in, or as a store, or drying
room, nor shall other processes than those of vulcanising be
carried on in them. No persons, except those engaged in vulcanising
processes, shall be allowed in the rooms.</p>

<p>There shall be at least 20 cubic meters (700 cubic feet) of air
space allowed for each person employed therein.</p>

<p>3. Only such quantities of carbon bisulphide shall be brought
into the vulcanising rooms as shall serve for the day’s supply.
Further storage shall be made in a special place separate from
the workrooms. Vessels to hold the vulcanising liquid shall be
strongly made, and when filled and not in use shall be well
covered.</p>

<p>4. Vulcanising and drying rooms shall be warmed only by
steam or hot-water pipes.</p>

<p>These rooms shall be lighted only by means of strong
incandescent electric lamps.</p>

<p>Exceptions from paragraphs 1 and 2 may be allowed by
the higher authorities.</p>

<p>5. Machines intended for vulcanising long sheets of cloth
shall be covered over (<i>e.g.</i>, with a glass casing) so as to prevent
as far as possible the entrance of carbon bisulphide fumes into
the workrooms, and from the casing the air shall be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
away effectually by means of a fan mechanically driven.
Entrance to the space which is enclosed shall only be allowed
in case of defects in the working.</p>

<p>In cases where a covering of the machine is not practicable
for technical reasons the higher authorities can, if suitable means
of protection are used (especially when the machine is placed
in an open hall, and provided that no person works at the
machine for more than two days a week), allow of exception
to the above arrangement.</p>

<p>6. Vulcanising of other articles (not mentioned in par. 5),
unless carried out in the open air, shall be done in covered-in
boxes into which the worker need only introduce his hands, and
so arranged as to keep the fumes away from the face of the
worker.</p>

<p>The air must be drawn away from the box by means of a
powerful draught.</p>

<p>7. Rule 6 shall apply in vulcanising both the outside and
inside of indiarubber goods. In vulcanising the inside no
worker shall be allowed to suck the fluid through with the
mouth.</p>

<p>8. The goods after their immersion in the vulcanising fluid
shall not lie open in the room, but shall either be placed
under a ventilated cover or at once be carried into the drying
chamber.</p>

<p>The drying chamber or drying rooms in which the wares are
exposed to artificial heat immediately after vulcanising shall be
so arranged that actual entrance into them for the putting in
or taking out of the vulcanised goods shall not be necessary. No
person shall be allowed to enter the drying chamber while work
is going on. The higher authorities can permit of exceptions to
this rule in the case of the drying of long rolls if sufficient protecting
arrangements are made.</p>

<p>9. When vulcanisation is effected by means of chloride of
sulphur the vessels or chambers used for holding it shall be
so arranged that escape of the fumes is prevented.</p>

<p>No person shall enter the vulcanising chamber until the
air in the chamber has been completely changed; it shall
not be used for purposes other than vulcanising.</p>

<p>10. Employment in vulcanising with carbon bisulphide or
in other work exposing the workers to carbon bisulphide vapour
shall not be allowed without a break for more than two hours
and in no case for more than four hours in one day; after
two hours a pause of at least one hour must be allowed before
resumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>No person under 18 years of age shall be employed.</p>

<p>11. The occupier shall provide all workers employed in work
mentioned in paragraph 10 with proper and sufficient overalls.
By suitable notices and supervision he shall see that when not
in use they are kept in their proper place.</p>

<p>12. Separate washing accommodation and dressing-rooms
for each sex shall be provided, distinct from the workrooms,
for all persons employed as stated in paragraph 11.</p>

<p>Water, soap, and towels and arrangements for keeping the
clothes put off before the commencement of work shall be
provided in sufficient amount.</p>

<p>13. The occupier shall appoint a duly qualified medical
practitioner (whose name shall be sent to the Inspector of
Factories) to supervise the health of those exposed to the
effects of carbon bisulphide. He shall examine the workers
once every month with a view to the detection of poisoning
by carbon bisulphide.</p>

<p>By direction of the medical practitioner workers showing
signs of carbon bisulphide poisoning shall be suspended from
work and those who appear peculiarly susceptible shall be
suspended permanently from work in processes mentioned in
paragraph 10.</p>

<p>14. The occupier shall keep a book, or make some official
responsible for its keeping, of the changes in the personnel in
the processes mentioned in paragraph 10 and as to their state
of health. The book shall contain—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) The name of the person keeping the book;</p>

<p>(2) The name of the appointed surgeon;</p>

<p>(3) Surname, Christian name, age, residence, date of
first employment, and date of leaving of every worker
mentioned in paragraph 10, and the nature of the employment;</p>

<p>(4) The date of any illness and its nature;</p>

<p>(5) Date of recovery;</p>

<p>(6) The dates and results of the prescribed medical
examination.</p>

</div>

<p>15. The occupier shall require the workers to subscribe to
the following conditions:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No worker shall take food into the vulcanising rooms;</p>

<p>The workers shall use the protection afforded in
paragraphs 5-7 and use the overalls in the work named;</p>

<p>The workers shall obey the directions of the occupier
given in accordance with Rule 5, paragraphs 1 and 2, Rule
8, paragraphs 1 and 2, and Rule 9, paragraph 2. Workers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
contravening these orders shall be liable to dismissal
without further notice.</p>

<p>If in a factory regulations already exist (paragraph 134(a)
of the Industrial Code) the above shall be included.</p>

</div>

<p>16. In the vulcanising rooms mentioned in Rule 1 there
shall be posted up a notice by the police stating—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The cubic capacity of the rooms;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The number of workers who may be employed.</p>

</div>

<p>Further, in every vulcanising room there shall be posted
up in a conspicuous place and in clear characters Rules 1-15
and the conditions in paragraph 15.</p>

</div>

<p>Reference should be made also to the Prussian Ministerial
Decree, dated February 23, 1910, on the preparation, storing,
and manufacture of carbon bisulphide, and to the French
Ministerial Circular, dated January 20, 1909 (Manufacture
of Indiarubber).</p>

<p>Employment of benzine and chloride of sulphur for
vulcanising is, from a hygienic standpoint, to be preferred to
that of the much more dangerous carbon bisulphide. The
same applies also to the process of the extraction of fat.</p>

<p>In the references made to general arrangements for the
protection of workers dealing with poisons, stress was laid on
the complete enclosing of extraction apparatus. This applies,
of course, to extraction by means of carbon bisulphide, both on
grounds of economy, health, and risk from fire.</p>

<p>On account of the risk to health, efforts have been made
to substitute other means of equal efficiency, free from danger.
Such a substitute may be found in <i>carbon tetrachloride</i>. This
extracts well, and dissolves grease spots (like benzine), is not
explosive, is scarcely inflammable, and is less poisonous than
the substances commonly used for extraction. Its employment
is to be recommended on hygienic grounds, but the
relatively high price may stand in the way of its use.</p>

<h4>Illuminating Gas Industry. Production of Tar and Coke</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_71">71-90</a> and <a href="#Page_199">199</a>)</p>

<p>In illuminating gas factories imperviousness of the whole
working system is especially important from an economical
and hygienic standpoint, since only in this way can danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
to the working staff be avoided. This applies especially
to the retorts, from which no gas should be allowed to
escape. If the exhaust is working satisfactorily this should
not be possible, as the pressure of the gas in the retorts during
distillation will be a negative one. Correct regulation of
pressure is thus of the greatest importance in the prevention
of poisoning in gas works.</p>

<p>Further, special precaution is necessary in operations with
gas purifying material containing cyanogen, since otherwise
the workers suffer from the gases developed from the gas
lime.</p>

<p>Work with gas purifying material should be so arranged
that injurious gases are carried away by suitable ventilating
arrangements. Consideration for the neighbourhood forbids
their discharge into the open air, and forbids also operations
with the gas purifying material in the open air; therefore non-injurious
removal of these gases is necessary.</p>

<p>Quenching of the coke also should, on account of the
annoyance to the working staff and to lessen nuisance to the
neighbourhood, be carried out so that the fumes are drawn into
the main chimney stack.</p>

<p>In coke ovens escape of tarry constituents and of poisonous
emanations are prevented by imperviousness of the apparatus,
by sufficiency of the exhaust draught, and especially by
passing the products of distillation, which cannot be condensed,
under a fire, or by absorbing them either with water
or oil.</p>

<p>Special precautionary measures are needed further in the
distillation of the washing oil, and generally escape of poisonous
emanations must be prevented by the greatest possible imperviousness
of the distillation system and corresponding
regulation of pressure.</p>

<h4>Gas Motors (Power Gas Stations)</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_80">80-5</a>)</p>

<p>The following points, taken from an Austrian Ministerial
Decree (dated December 2, 1903), for the prevention of
poisoning in power gas works, may be useful:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Power Gas Installations</span></p>

<p>In mixed gas installations (Dowson, water gas) of the older
system, the way in which the gas is produced causes the
whole apparatus and pipes to be under slight negative pressure,
because the steam required for the process must be blown into
the generator. In these works, therefore, a small special steam
boiler is required and a gas receiver to store the gas.</p>

<p>In more modern suction generator gas installations the
piston is used to suck in steam and air as well as the gases
arising in the generator and to draw them into the motor
cylinder. Thus the whole system is kept in a condition of
slight negative pressure during the process. While the suction
generator gas system is working, only so much gas is produced
as the motor uses for the time being, so that with this system
there is no greater store of gas than is requisite.</p>

<p>In such an installation the following rules should be borne
in mind:</p>

<p>1. All the apparatus (gas pipes, valves, &amp;c.) must be constructed
and maintained in a completely impervious condition.
Any water seals especially which may be in use must receive
attention.</p>

<p>2. Precautions must be taken to prevent the gases from the
generator passing into the coolers and purifiers when the engine
is at rest.</p>

<p>3. Care is to be taken when the apparatus is at rest to prevent
any possible subsequent escape of gas into the room where the
apparatus is installed.</p>

<p>4. The return of explosive gas out of the gas engine into
the gas pipe by failure to ignite or other accident, must be made
impossible.</p>

<p>5. The apparatus through which the generator is charged
must possess a tightly fitting double valve to prevent escape
of gas into the room during charging.</p>

<p>6. The pipes for conducting away the unpleasantly smelling
bituminous constituents in the water mixed with sulphuretted
hydrogen from the scrubbers must not communicate with the
workroom.</p>

<p>7. Precautions must be taken to minimise the danger
during the cleaning of the generator (removal of ashes and
slag).</p>

<p>8. All stop-cocks and valves are to be so arranged that their
position at any time (open or shut) is clearly visible from outside.</p>

<p>9. Purifiers with a capacity greater than two cubic meters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
must be provided with appliances which make possible thorough
removal of the gas before they are opened.</p>

<p>10. The gas washing and cleaning apparatus and pipes are
to be fitted with gauges indicating the pressure existing in them
at any moment.</p>

<p>11. When a suction gas plant is first installed and also at
times when there is no gas in the pipes and plant between
the generator and the engine, gas must be blown in until all
air is expelled before the engine is set going.</p>

<p>12. During the cleaning of apparatus and pipes which, when
in action, contain gas, the rooms must be thoroughly ventilated.</p>

<p>13. Rooms in which suction gas plant is installed must be
of such a height that all the plant and its connections can be
easily reached for cleaning, &amp;c., and be capable of such free
ventilation as to render impossible an accumulation of gas.</p>

<p>14. These rooms must be separated from living rooms by
a wall without any openings in it. Emanations also must be
prevented as far as possible from entering into living or working
rooms situated over the gas engine.</p>

<p>15. Erection of apparatus for generating and purifying
suction gas in cellars shall only be allowed if specially effective
ventilation is provided by natural or mechanical means.</p>

<p>Other Regulations are those of the Prussian Ministerial
Decree, dated June 20, 1904, as to the arrangement and
management of suction gas premises.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Acetylene Gas Installations</span></h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_85">85-7</a>)</p>

<p>The following regulations for the protection of workers in
acetylene gas installations are taken from the Prussian
Ministerial Decree, dated 2 November, 1897:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Preparation and condensation of acetylene on the one
hand, and liquefaction on the other, must be carried on in
separate buildings.</p>

<p>2. If the pressure employed for condensation of the gas
exceeds eight atmospheres, this work must take place in a room
set apart for the purpose.</p>

<p>3. Rooms in which acetylene is prepared, condensed, or
liquefied shall not be used as, nor be in direct connection with,
living rooms. They must be well lighted and ventilated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The carbide must be kept in closed watertight vessels,
so as to ensure perfect dryness and only such quantities shall
be taken out as are needed. The vessels must be kept in dry,
light, well-ventilated rooms; cellar rooms may not be used for
storage purposes.</p>

<p>5. Crushing of carbide must be done with the greatest
possible avoidance of dust. Workers are to be provided with
respirators and goggles.</p>

<p>6. Acetylene gasometers must be fitted up in the open air
or in a well-ventilated room, separated from the gas generator.
Every gas receiver must have a water gauge showing the pressure
in the receiver.</p>

<p>7. Between the gasometer and receiver a gas purifier must
be provided so as to remove impurities (phosphoretted hydrogen,
arseniuretted hydrogen, carbon bisulphide, ammonia, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>8. Condensation of acetylene gas at a pressure exceeding
ten atmospheres shall only be done in combination with cooling.</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Distribution and Use of Power and Illuminating Gas</span></h4>

<p>The Austrian Gas Regulations (of July 18, 1906) contain
general provisions as to impermeability and security of the
gas pipes and the precautions to be observed in their installation.
Special directions follow as to main flues, material,
dimensions, branches, and connections, valve arrangements,
testing of the pipes against leakage, directions for discovering
leaks, and other defects; also the nature of the branch pipes
(dimensions and material), valves, cocks, syphons, water seals,
and pressure gauges. In addition there are directions as to
testing pipes and how to deal with escape of gas, freezing of
pipes, and other mishaps.</p>

<h4>Ammonia</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_90">90-3</a> and <a href="#Page_175">175</a>)</p>

<p>In the production of ammonia and ammonium salts
(ammonium sulphate) combination of the ammoniacal vapour
with the sulphuric acid is accompanied with the formation of
volatile dangerous gases containing sulphuretted hydrogen
and cyanogen compounds, which produce marked oppression
and sometimes endanger the health of the workers. Drawing-off
these fumes into the furnace (practised sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
in small industries) is not advisable, as the sulphuretted
hydrogen is burnt to sulphur dioxide; if it is burnt absorption
of the sulphur dioxide should follow, or working it up into
sulphuric acid (Leymann). Often these gases are freed from
cyanogen compounds and sulphuretted hydrogen by means of
gas purifying materials, such as are used in gas works. The
whole apparatus must be impervious. Where liquids containing
ammonia are used exhaust ventilation is necessary.</p>

<h4>Cyanogen, Cyanogen Compounds</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_93">93-5</a> and <a href="#Page_195">195-7</a>)</p>

<p>Processes in which cyanogen gas can develop, require to
be done under a powerful exhaust draught.</p>

<p>In the production of cyanogen compounds possibility of the
escape of hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid) has to be borne in
mind. Such escape is possible in its production from raw
animal products.</p>

<p>The most careful cleanliness and observance of general
measures for personal hygiene are necessary in factories in
which cyanogen compounds are manufactured or handled. In
crushing cyanide of potassium the workers should wear indiarubber
gloves and respirators. The products should be stored
in closed vessels in dry store rooms set apart for the purpose.</p>

<p>Modern cyanide of potassium factories which work up
molasses, from which the sugar has been removed, and also
residuary distillery liquors, so far conform with hygienic requirements
that all the apparatus is under negative pressure,
so that poisonous gases cannot escape into the workrooms.</p>

<h4>Coal Tar, Tar Products</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_96">96-119</a>)</p>

<p>Care must be taken for the removal of injurious gases
developed in the manipulation and use of tar (tar distillation)
and in the processes of cleaning connected therewith. This can
be most effectively done by carrying on the processes in closed
apparatus. Hofmann describes such a factory where all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
mixing vessels in which the distillation products are further
treated are completely closed in, so that even in mixing and
running off, no contact is possible with the material.</p>

<p>The vessels for holding tar, tar-water, &amp;c., must be impervious
and kept covered. Only the cold pitch and asphalt
should be stored in open pits. The cooling of the distillation
products and residues, so long as they give off poisonous
and strongly-smelling fumes, should be carried out in metal
or bricked receivers. Such directions find a place in the
‘Technical Instructions’ appended to the German Factory
Code. Without doubt, tar is, because of its smell and for
other reasons, unpleasant to handle, and the danger to health
from contact with it is not a matter of indifference. Spilling
of small quantities of tar during transport and other manipulations
can hardly be avoided. Careful cleanliness, therefore,
on the part of workers is strongly urged. It may
be mentioned that if tar is covered with a layer of tar-water,
treatment with acid fluids develops sulphur and
cyanogen compounds, which may affect the workers. Tar
water should, therefore, be separated carefully from the tar
and used for the preparation of ammonia.</p>

<p>The same remarks as to cleanliness, &amp;c., apply in the
manufacture of felt, lamp-black, and briquettes, with use of tar.
Saturation of felt, and manufacture of tar plaster should be
done in closed apparatus. In the production of lamp-black,
even with a great number of soot chambers, there is escape of
soot causing nuisance to workers and the neighbourhood.
Complete avoidance of this seems to be difficult, so that
measures for personal hygiene must be assured. In briquette
factories it has been found useful to heat the tar by means of
steam instead of by direct fire, which renders possible the use
of a closed apparatus and mechanical stirring.</p>

<p>In the distillation of tar, during the first distillation period
(first runnings) unpleasant and injurious gases containing
ammonia and sulphur escape from the stills. These should
(according to Leymann) be carried away through closed pipes
branching off from the lower end of the running-off pipe,
either into the furnace (in doing which a possible back flash of
flame is to be guarded against) or be subjected to purification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
by lime or oxide of iron (similar to that in the case of illuminating
gas) with a view to recovery of ammonia and sulphur.
The lower end of the distillation pipes should be U-shaped
so as to form a liquid seal—the pipes for the drawing off of
the gases branching off before the curve. In the later stages
of distillation risk can be checked by careful cooling and
imperviousness of the apparatus.</p>

<p>Very unpleasant yellow fumes develop in great quantity
when pitch is run off from the hot still. Hence hot pitch should
not be run off into open pitch receptacles, but be cooled first in
closed receptacles.</p>

<p>The crude products obtained by distillation (light oil,
creosote oil) are subjected to purification consisting in treatment
on the one hand with alkali and on the other with acid
and followed by fractional distillation. In these processes
injurious fumes may develop, therefore they must—as already
mentioned—be carried on in closed vessels provided with
means of escape for fumes and appliances for mechanical
stirring; the fumes drawn off must be led into the chimney
stack.</p>

<p>In the distillation of brown coal, of tar, and of resin, it is
necessary, as in the distillation of coal tar, to insist above all on
careful cooling and condensation, and thorough absorption of
uncondensed gases in washing towers. Special precautionary
rules are necessary to guard against the danger of entering tar
stills for cleaning purposes. Such directions were approved in
Great Britain in 1904 in view of accidents which occurred in
this way:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tar Distilling</span></p>

<p>The following directions<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> are approved by the Home Office and
are applicable to factories in which is carried on the distillation
of tar for the production of naphtha, light oil, creosote oil,
and pitch.</p>

<p>1. During the process of cleaning, every tar still should be
completely isolated from adjoining tar stills either by disconnecting
the pipe leading from the swan neck to the condenser
worm, or by disconnecting the waste gas pipe fixed to the worm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
end or receiver. Blank flanges should be inserted between the
disconnections. In addition, the pit discharge pipe or cock at
the bottom of the still should be disconnected.</p>

<p>2. Every tar still should be ventilated and allowed to cool
before persons are allowed to enter.</p>

<p>3. Every tar still should be inspected by the foreman or
other responsible person before any workman is allowed to enter.</p>

<p>4. The inspecting foreman on first entering any tar still or
tank, and all persons employed in tar stills or tanks in which there
are no cross stays or obstructions likely to cause entanglement,
should be provided with a belt securely fastened round the
body with a rope attached, the free end being left with two
men outside whose sole duty should be to watch and draw out
any person appearing to be affected by gas. The belt and rope
should be adjusted and worn in such a manner that the wearer
can be drawn up head foremost and through the manhole and
not across it.</p>

<p>5. A bottle of compressed oxygen, with mouthpiece, should
be kept at all times ready for use; and printed instructions
as to the use of this bottle, and the method to be employed for
resuscitation by means of artificial respiration should be kept
constantly affixed. A draft of such instructions is appended.</p>

<p>6. A supply of suitable chemical respirators properly charged
and in good condition should be kept ready for use in case of
emergency arising from sulphuretted hydrogen or certain
poisonous gases. (Granules of carbon saturated with a solution
of caustic soda readily absorb sulphuretted hydrogen and may
be used for charging respirators.)</p>

<p>7. The use of naked lights should be strictly prohibited in
any portion of the works where gas of an inflammable nature
is liable to be given off.</p>

<p>8. Each still should be provided with a proper safety valve,
which should at all times be kept in efficient working condition.</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Gassing</span></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>—The first symptoms are giddiness, weakness in the legs, and
palpitation of the heart. If a man feels these he should at once move into
fresh warm air, when he will quickly recover if slightly affected. He should
avoid exposure to cold. He should not walk home too soon after recovery;
any exertion is harmful.</p>

<p><i>First Aid.</i>—Remove the patient into fresh warm air. Send for the oxygen
apparatus. Send for a doctor. Begin artificial breathing at once if the
patient is insensible and continue it for at least half-an-hour, or until natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
breathing returns. Give oxygen<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> at the same time and continue it after
natural breathing returns.</p>

<p><i>Artificial Breathing</i> (<i>Schäfer Method</i>).—Place the patient face downwards
as shown in the diagrams.</p>

<p>Kneel at the side of the patient and place your hands flat in the small of
his back with thumbs nearly touching, and the fingers spread out on each
side of the body over the lowest ribs (<i>see</i> Diagram 1).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/diagram1.jpg" width="500" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 1</span></p>
</div>

<p>Then promote artificial breathing by leaning forward over the patient
and, without violence, produce a firm, steady, downward pressure (<i>see</i> Diagram
2). Next release all pressure by swinging your body backwards without
lifting your hands from the patient (<i>see</i> Diagram 1).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/diagram2.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 2</span></p>
</div>

<p>Repeat this pressure and relaxation of pressure without any marked
pause between the movements, <i>about 15 times a minute</i>, until breathing is
established.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>In my opinion as expressed in the general discussion, use of
breathing apparatus (smoke helmets) with oxygen is strongly
advisable; these implements must be put on before entering the
still.</p>

<p>In creosoting wood, opening the apparatus and taking out
the steeped wood should only be done when the apparatus is
sufficiently cooled, as otherwise injurious fumes escape.</p>

<p>In heating asphalt unpleasant fumes arise which should
be drawn off into a furnace, or absorbed by a condenser
charged with oil (Leymann); open pans should be avoided, as
injurious to workers.</p>

<h4>Organic Dye-stuffs, Coal-Tar Colours.</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_107">107-19</a> and <a href="#Page_204">204-15</a>)</p>

<p>The hygienic measures to be adopted for the prevention of
industrial poisoning in coal-tar colour factories are chiefly
concerned with the poisonous nature on the one hand of the raw
material (benzene, toluene, &amp;c.) and on the other of the intermediate
products (nitrobenzene, aniline, toluidine, &amp;c.) and
the subsidiary substances (chlorine, acids, especially nitric
acid, &amp;c.,) used.</p>

<p>The most important measures are as follows:</p>

<p>In purifying the raw materials (benzene, &amp;c.) the distillation
requires to be done under effective cooling and in impervious
apparatus. If injurious solvents are employed (such as
pyridine in the production of anthracene) the manipulations
should be performed in closed apparatus if possible, under
negative pressure. The fumes exhausted should be carefully
condensed by cooling or absorbed by a spray of water or oil.</p>

<p>In view of the poisonous nature of benzene, the apparatus,
stills, receivers, tanks, tank waggons, &amp;c., should only be
entered for the purpose of cleaning or repairing after preliminary
thorough removal of all residue of benzene, complete isolation
from all similar apparatus near, and thorough ventilation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Workers entering the stills, &amp;c., should always be equipped with
breathing apparatus (smoke helmets) and with a supply of
oxygen. Other aids, such as safety belts which are held by
helpers, are not here advocated in view of the often sudden
fatal poisoning, especially as the rescuer is easily induced to
spring to the assistance of his unfortunate mate without the
necessary equipment. The frequency of such accidents calls
urgently for the use of breathing apparatus.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of <i>diazo-</i> and <i>nitroso-compounds</i> and
generally in nitrating operations poisonous nitrous fumes are
developed. By reduction in an acid solution, acid fumes
and singularly pungent-smelling compounds can be given off.
If reduction by means of tin is practised, the arsenic in the tin
can cause evolution of the extremely poisonous arseniuretted
hydrogen gas. In sulphonating, sulphur dioxide can develop;
and sulphuretted hydrogen gas on heating with sulphur or
sulphide of sodium.</p>

<p>All manipulations should take place in tightly closed-in
apparatus provided with exhaust, and the gases drawn off
should be absorbed or effectively carried away. In the case
of many injurious gases it is not sufficient merely to conduct
them into the flue; they ought to be condensed and got rid of.
Thus acid fumes (nitrous fumes, sulphur dioxide, hydrochloric
acid vapour, chlorine gas) are neutralised by water or milk of
lime, or a solution of soda; ammonia or alcohol by water;
sulphuretted hydrogen and arseniuretted hydrogen by lime
and oxide of iron; aniline, &amp;c., by dilute acids.</p>

<p>Production of <i>nitrobenzene</i>, by nitrating benzene requires
to be done in closed apparatus, provided with mechanical
agitators. In the subsequent separation of the nitrating acids
from the resulting nitro-compounds, escape of vapourised
nitro-compounds can scarcely be avoided even if closed
apparatus is used. Provision, therefore, must be made for
abundant ventilation of the workrooms. The reduction of the
nitro-compounds (nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene) to aniline
(toluidine) must similarly take place in closed agitating vessels.
Introduction of the iron filings and sulphuric or hydrochloric
acids, also the subsequent saturation with lime, and driving
over of the aniline, &amp;c., with steam, and collection of the distillate,
must take place in completely closed apparatus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Nevertheless, escape of small quantities of aniline is very
difficult to prevent unless ample ventilation is provided.</p>

<p>In the production of <i>fuchsin</i> by heating aniline hydrochloride
(toluidine, red oil) with nitrobenzene (formerly arsenic acid)
in closed vessels, furnished with mechanical stirring apparatus
the aniline remaining unconverted after the melting escapes in
the form of steam carrying aniline fumes, even with careful
condensation, so that thorough ventilation and the other general
measures for the protection of workers set forth on pp. <a href="#Page_242">242
<i>et seq.</i></a> are required.</p>

<p>Marked injury to health and distress to workers through acid
fumes are sometimes caused by the denitration of the waste
mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids in the nitrating process,
that is, by the separation of nitric acid from the acid mixture.
This denitration takes place usually in the Glover towers of the
lead chamber system which is often associated with the manufacture
of aniline. The mixed nitro-compounds of the waste
acids, however, are often not completely condensed, but pass
through the chambers and Gay-Lussac towers and escape into
the air, whence arises the constant smell of nitrobenzene in
aniline factories (Leymann). In the production of <i>naphthylamine</i>
and recovery of chlorinated products, escaping chlorine
should be led into chloride of lime chambers, hydrochloric
acid fumes into towers to be absorbed by water and milk of
lime or a solution of soda.</p>

<p>In aniline factories danger can scarcely be wholly avoided,
as the workers, on the one hand, come into contact with
poisonous substances, nitrobenzene, aniline, &amp;c., and on the
other hand, in spite of all technical hygienic measures, can
hardly help breathing in some of the aniline. Apart from the
technical regulations, therefore, there must be insistence on
cleanliness of the workrooms, personal cleanliness on the part
of the workers (washing, baths, working suits, cloak-rooms, &amp;c.).
Besides this, contact with aniline, nitrobenzene, &amp;c., wetting
of the body and clothes with these substances, and, especially
spilling, splashing, and scattering these fluids must be carefully
avoided. The workers require to be suitably instructed as to
the symptoms of nitrobenzene and aniline poisoning, and the
right steps to take, if poisoned. The oxygen apparatus must
always be at hand, ready for use; the workers must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
instructed how to use it. Further, workers, especially those
newly employed, must be under supervision in order that
assistance may be rendered them on the first signs of poisoning;
medical assistance ought to be within easy reach. Workers
also should know of the tendency of aniline to cause cancer of
the bladder.</p>

<p>Precautions against the poisonous nitro-derivatives of
benzene (nitrophenol, picric acid, &amp;c.), which are in the form
of poisonous dust, must take the form of entirely closed-in
grinding and packing apparatus, or, at all events, removal of
the dust at its source.</p>

<p>Among official regulations may be mentioned the Prussian
Ministerial Edict, dated December 18, 1908, as to purification
and storage of benzene, and further the Regulations dated
December 13, 1907, and December 30, 1908, in force in Great
Britain for the manufacture of nitro- and amido-derivatives of
benzene, and the manufacture of explosives with use of dinitrobenzene
or dinitrotoluene.</p>

<h3>VI<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>PREVENTIVE REGULATIONS—THE EXTRACTION
OF METALS (SMELTING WORK IN GENERAL)</i></span></h3>

<p>Danger is incurred when the furnace leaks, a condition which
generally occurs in the course of time, or if gases escape during
the necessary manipulations through the working doors. This
can be avoided by maintaining the walls in as air-tight a state
as possible; but as very small leakages are almost unavoidable
the best course is to so regulate the draught in the furnace (by
means of fans) that a slight negative pressure always exists
in it. Naturally, poisonous gases escaping from the furnace
such as sulphur dioxide, carbonic oxide, carbon dioxide, and
hydrocarbons require to be drawn away and rendered harmless.
This can often be done by merely conducting them into
the main flue. Gases containing carbonic oxide possess high
heating capacity, and their escape can usually be prevented by
suitable cupola bells. They can be led away in impervious
conduits and utilised for heating purposes or for driving gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
engines. Entering the flues for cleaning or repairing purposes
is especially dangerous; and as it is difficult to isolate one
portion entirely from another, such operations might well
be carried on by persons equipped with breathing apparatus
(smoke helmets or oxygen apparatus).</p>

<p>In roasting operations handwork can be largely replaced by
furnaces worked mechanically. If the gases generated are rich
in sulphur dioxide they can be utilised for the manufacture of
sulphuric acid or for the production of liquid sulphur dioxide
either directly or after concentration; if not, they must be
rendered harmless by treatment with milk of lime in absorption
towers. Other methods of rendering the sulphur dioxide
(unsuited for manufacture of sulphuric acid) harmless depend
on treatment with minerals containing calcium carbonate, or
magnesium or aluminium hydrate, sodium sulphide, &amp;c.
Sometimes the sulphurous gases are led into blast furnaces
containing oxide of iron and coal (so as to form sulphide of
iron) or are absorbed by means of moist scraps of sheet iron or
brown coal or peat briquettes.</p>

<p>Use of chlorine compounds in the extraction of metals from
ores (silver, copper) causes evolution of chlorine and hydrochloric
acid vapour. These should be dealt with in absorption
towers. Metallic fumes are collected by suitable condensing
arrangements. Flue dust is retained in flue dust chambers,
but in the cleaning of such condensing flues and chambers
danger to the workers is considerable and they should be
equipped with respirators, working suits, &amp;c. Personal
hygiene must be insisted on.</p>

<p>In blast furnace work, industrial poisoning occurs mainly
from escaping gases rich in carbonic oxide. They may also
contain sulphur dioxide and cyanogen compounds. The high
proportion of carbonic oxide, however, makes these gases
valuable and serviceable, because of their great heating value.
They are, therefore, now led away and utilised, the furnace
being closed by a cupola bell only opened by means of a
mechanical contrivance when charging is necessary; while this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
is being done the ignited blast furnace gases pour out, and the
workers retire from the opening, so that danger to them is
avoided. The construction of a blast furnace with a cupola
bell can be seen in <a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>. The blast furnace gases are conducted
away by an opening in the side, and pass along special
pipes to be utilised, after having gone through a purifying
process mainly for the removal of flue dust, &amp;c. The gases
serve partly for the heating of the blast for the furnace itself,
and partly for driving the gas engines which serve the electrical
power apparatus, electric lighting, &amp;c., in the works. Through
the rational utilisation of the blast furnace gases, the workers
are protected from their injurious action during the working
of the furnace. Serious gas poisoning, however, occurs not
infrequently to workers who have to enter the gas mains for
cleaning purposes. Workers, therefore, should only be permitted
to enter the flues, &amp;c., a considerable time after the
process has been stopped and after as complete and thorough
a ventilation of the system as is possible.</p>

<p>Any portion of the gas system which is to undergo cleaning
must be completely isolated. Ventilation is best effected by
the introduction of compressed air. Thus a foundry (in the
Duisburg district) has provided all its cellars and passages,
through which gas pipes pass, and which must be entered during
repairs, with compressed air pipes. It is, however, advisable
that gas conduits should only be entered by workers equipped
with breathing apparatus and oxygen supply. Naturally
adequate instruction of workers and training in first aid are
necessary, as well as a sufficient supply of oxygen in constant
readiness.</p>

<p>Injurious gases can escape from the furnace during tapping
and slag running; poisonous gases with a disagreeable
odour, from presence of sulphuretted hydrogen, also arise in
granulating the slag, that is, when the fluid slag is led into water
for subsequent use in preparation of cement. These gases
should be collected by hoods, and be carried away as far as
possible.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of <i>steel</i> by the <i>Bessemer</i> or <i>Thomas-Gilchrist</i>
process, the dark smoke arising out of the converter
during the blowing operation should be drawn off (led into
flues), as it is injurious to health. In the <i>Martin</i> furnaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
poisoning may occur, especially when the gas flues are entered
after cessation of work. In letting out the gas in order to stop
the furnaces, the gas and air valves must first be closed and the
outlet valves for gas be opened only after the pipes have been
filled with steam. Steam is to be driven through until the
pipes are quite free from gas, and the system only entered after
it has become thoroughly cooled. If need arises for entering
portions of the system while neighbouring parts are still filled
with gas, the workers employed require to be provided with
breathing apparatus and smoke helmets.</p>

<p>In the transport of <i>ferro-silicon</i> several cases of poisoning
have occurred. Cautionary regulations, therefore, relating to
this work have been found necessary.</p>

<p>Such directions are contained in the police regulations of
the Prussian Minister of Trade and Industry respecting the
transport on the Rhine of corrosive and poisonous substances
(dated September 29, 1910).</p>

<p>It is prescribed: (1) that ferro-silicon be packed in strong
watertight cases of wood or metal; (2) that on the cases
be inscribed, legibly and indelibly, the notice ‘Ferro-silicon.
To be kept dry! With care!’ (3) that the substance be
delivered dry and in dry cases; (4) that the cases be
stored in airy places on the deck of the ship in such a
manner that they are protected from wet.</p>

<p>Further, care is to be taken that the storage on ships is
done in such a way that possible damage to the material in
which it is packed entails no risk. The harbour authorities
where loading or landing takes place can deal with special
cases as they think fit.</p>

<p>International regulation as to transport of ferro-silicon in
the spirit of the above regulations would be most desirable in
view of the oversea trade in this substance.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<h4>Lead</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_120">120-40</a> and <a href="#Page_177">177-82</a>)</p>

<p>For protection against lead poisoning, the most widely
spread of the slow industrial poisonings, all those measures are
of moment which we have described in our general discussion
on protection against danger from poison in industries, both
personal and general.</p>

<p>Personal hygiene, especially careful washing after work,
prohibition of eating in workrooms, suitable working clothes,
provision of cloak rooms, meal rooms, baths, &amp;c., are important
and effective measures for the protection of workers against
industrial lead poisoning.</p>

<p>The worker should naturally be adequately instructed as to
the risk. Appropriate printed notices are especially adapted
for this purpose.</p>

<p>Further, selection of workers should be made under medical
supervision. Workers who suffer from specific disease which, if
associated with lead poisoning, may prove dangerous, should be
excluded from all contact with lead. Among such illnesses must
be reckoned tuberculosis in all its forms, alcoholism, epilepsy,
tendency to mental disease (nervous disposition, hysteria,
neurasthenia, &amp;c.), rheumatism, and disease of the kidneys.</p>

<p>Overtime work undoubtedly increases risk; therefore working
hours should be shortened as much as possible, and handwork
replaced by machine work where possible. Young
persons and women especially should be excluded from work in
lead. Alternation of employment also is beneficial and essential
in very dangerous lead work, because the poison accumulates
in the body and only during intervals wherein absolutely
no poison can be absorbed has it time to be eliminated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Periodical medical examination by a surgeon is of great
value with systematic entry of the results of examination in a
health register. As bearing on this, early diagnosis is of the
greatest importance, so that workers in whom the first signs
of lead poisoning appear may at once be suspended or transferred
to other work.</p>

<p>Lead workers should take suitable nourishing food and
avoid particularly alcoholic excess.</p>

<p>When the danger is due to fumes or dust in the air
the measures prescribed on pages 242-55 apply, particularly
those which aim at keeping the workrooms and the air in
the factories free of them by locally applied exhaust ventilation.</p>

<p>In order to replace or reduce the use of lead we strongly
advocate the use of non-poisonous, or at any rate less poisonous,
substances, where this can be done without technical difficulties,
as, for instance, carborundum discs instead of lead in polishing
of precious stones, leadless glaze in pottery for lead glaze (so
far as this is possible, as to which see page 319), beds free of
lead (in different industries) for lead beds. In a number of
cases, however, such substitution is impracticable on technical
grounds or can only partially be carried out, as, for example, in
letterpress printing and in the paint and colour industry, in
which the prohibition of lead has often been repeatedly urged.
So far, unfortunately, it must be admitted that repeated
attempts to find a non-poisonous substitute for lead colours,
especially for white lead, of equal value technically, have not
succeeded. Endeavours have been made to substitute for lead,
zinc preparations (zinc white, lithopone, &amp;c.), but hitherto (in
regard to durability, opacity, &amp;c.) with incomplete success.</p>

<p>Mention must be made of the measures based upon the relatively
non-poisonous nature of lead sulphide. Lead sulphide
is, in spite of various assertions to the contrary, practically
non-poisonous; a fact attributable to its insolubility in water
and weak acids. As lead sulphide is the only non-poisonous
lead compound it is a duty to take advantage of this fact for
purposes of lead prophylaxis.</p>

<p>Attempts with this end in view were made by the introduction
of sulphur soaps in lead factories. Soaps containing
in large quantity soluble alkaline sulphides convert lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
compounds adhering to the skin into black lead sulphide.
The lead compounds are in this way made harmless, and
besides this the worker is impelled to remove the staining
by washing. Such a sulphur soap has been brought into
the market under the name of akremnin soap, but does not
enjoy special popularity with the workmen on account of its
unpleasant smell.</p>

<p>The struggle against the risks of lead employment has been
going on ever since efforts for the protection of workers were
commenced.</p>

<p>The International Association for Labour Legislation has
made valuable inquiries in this direction. The question of
lead poisoning had been repeatedly discussed by this Association
and its branches in various countries. The International
Labour Bureau also took up the issue and in 1906—supported
by the Institute for General Welfare in Frankfurt a-M.—offered
a prize for the best treatise on the prevention of industrial
lead poisoning. The outcome of this competition was the
volume compiled by Leymann, ‘Die Bekämpfung der Bleigefahr
in der Industrie’ (published by Fischer, Jena, 1908).</p>

<p>In connection with the resolution adopted at the third
Congress of the International Association for Labour Legislation
the Union of Social Reform (as the German branch is
called) addressed the Federal Council on the white lead question,
the chief points insisted upon being the need for: (1) regulations
for the house painting industry in pursuance of Section 120 of
the Factory Code; (2) report by the Imperial Health Office on
the practicability of substitutes for lead; (3) exclusion of lead
colours from use in the painting of public buildings; and (4)
treatment of lead poisoning by the State Insurance Office as an
accident entitling to compensation.</p>

<p>These demands were supported by the central office of the
Society for Promoting the Welfare of Workers, which had as
far back as its seventh conference in 1898 occupied itself with
the question of dangerous trades and especially, at its conference
in 1905, taken up the subject of the protection of workers
against industrial poisoning.</p>

<p>In Germany these efforts resulted in the passage of a
number of Imperial Regulations for separate lead industries.</p>

<p>In other countries similar action was set on foot. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Austria, where the subject is of special importance in view of
the part played by lead in the home industries, the Government
undertook to improve the conditions in industries attended
with risk of lead poisoning. For this purpose the Statistical
Office of the Ministry of Commerce and Labour has, since
1904, carried out extensive inquiries into lead and zinc smelting
works, paint and colour factories, the painting and varnishing
trades, letterpress printing, and the ceramic industry. The
results are contained in the volume ‘Lead Poisoning in
Smelting Works and Industries Generally’ (published by
Hölder, Vienna).</p>

<p>As in Germany and Austria, so also in Great Britain, France,
Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, regulations in
various lead industries were enforced after previous official
inquiry and report.</p>

<p>A general code, however, affecting all lead industries has
only been published in one or two states. And yet this would,
in my opinion, be of very great practical value as it is hardly
possible to regulate each single branch of industry.</p>

<p>In Germany the Regulations dated May 26, 1903, dealing
with lead colours are certainly comprehensive, but relate
primarily to paint factories, and are not, therefore, a general
Order in the sense indicated. In Saxony the decree of June
27, 1901, made notification of lead poisoning compulsory,
and in the subsequent decree of April 16, 1909, prescribed
general measures against lead poisoning. In Switzerland
single cantons have made general regulations. In France, by
a decree dated April 23, 1908 (in pursuance of the general
law of June 12, 1893), all industries attended with risk of
lead poisoning were brought under Regulation.</p>

<p>We give the provisions of this interesting decree, as it is a
good example of the kind of Regulations we have in mind.</p>

<h5>Lead Smelting Works</h5>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_122">122-31</a>)</p>

<p>As the fumes in lead smelting works contain a high proportion
of lead, all apparatus, especially furnaces and working
doors, should be provided with efficient exhaust ventilation
and all flues, furnaces, and other apparatus be as airtight as
possible. Where lead dust is created exhaust ventilation
locally applied is necessary. Two of the most important
preventive measures are personal cleanliness and alternation of
employment. Dust arising in the furnaces and borne along
by the furnace gases together with arsenical fumes and dust
must be deposited in flues or chambers.</p>

<p>In view of the importance of proper instruction of smelters
as regards the danger we quote the warning note prepared
by the Institute for Industrial Hygiene, Frankfurt a.-M.,
which deserves wide circulation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lead Leaflet for Smelters</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>How does Lead Poisoning arise?</i></p>

<p>The danger of lead poisoning in lead, spelter and other
smelting premises can be avoided if due care is observed.</p>

<p>Lead poisoning occurs when lead enters the system. This
takes place by breathing dust and fume containing lead, or by
eating and drinking, smoking, snuff taking and tobacco chewing
if food or tobacco is taken into the mouth with dirty hands
and dirty face and beard.</p>

<p>No one is immune from lead. Lead accumulates in the
body of careless persons and he who is not sick to-day can be so
to-morrow or after weeks or months.</p>

<p class="center"><i>How can Plumbism be avoided?</i></p>

<p>All smelters must observe cleanliness. In this respect they
should see to the following points:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>1. It is to their interest to see that the exhaust ventilation
is kept in order and that the Special Rules or Regulations are
exactly followed. Further, special clothing should be worn,
the mouth and nose should be covered, and the floors sprinkled.</p>

<p>2. It is especially important that in intervals and at the
close of work the mouth, face, beard, and hands should be
carefully cleaned. Food should not be eaten or the premises
left without putting on fresh clothes and thoroughly washing
or, still better, bathing. When drinking, the edge of the
drinking glass should not be fingered with dirty hands.
Especially important is it that the teeth should be cleaned
and the mouth washed out.</p>

<p>3. During work smoking, snuff taking, and tobacco chewing,
which invariably convey lead into the mouth, should be given
up, as it is impossible to prevent the hands getting contaminated
with lead. Lighting the pipe with glowing lead ashes
is in the highest degree dangerous from the risk of inhaling
lead fume. The body must be strengthened to withstand the
action of lead. Moderation in drinking, especially avoidance
of spirits, should be observed. Alcoholic subjects succumb to
lead poisoning much more readily than the temperate.</p>

<p>Food should be abundant and rich in fat, for example milk
and bacon. Thick soups are excellent before work. Work
should never be begun on an empty stomach. And lastly as
much fresh air as possible. Walking, athletics, work in the
garden and field will help to keep off many an attack. If
anyone thinks that he is suffering from lead poisoning he should
at once in his own and his family’s interest see the doctor of his
sick club.</p>

<p>The following are the</p>

<p class="center"><i>General Regulations</i></p>

<p>1. Workrooms in which lead ores are roasted, sintered, or
smelted, pig lead produced and submitted to further treatment,
distillation of rich lead (bullion cupellation) litharge, red lead,
or other oxides of lead prepared, ground or sieved, stored or
packed, or zinc skimmings distilled, shall be roomy, high, and
so arranged that a sufficient constant exchange of air takes
place. They shall be provided with a level and solid floor to
allow of easy removal of dust by a moist method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>The walls shall be smooth so as to prevent collection of
dust; they shall be either washed down or lime washed at least
once a year.</p>

<p>Provided that this shall not apply in the case of calcining
sheds with wooden walls.</p>

<p>2. An abundant supply of good drinking water, protected
against contamination from dust, shall be provided for the
workers on the furnaces and smelting pots, and in such close
proximity to them, that they can obtain it at any time without
having to go into the open air.</p>

<p>Arrangements for sprinkling the floors shall be provided
near the furnaces. The floors of the rooms mentioned in
paragraph 1 shall be wet cleansed at least once daily.</p>

<p>3. Prepared (i.e. concentrated) lead ores and leady smelting
products, unless moist, shall not be crushed except in an
apparatus so arranged as to prevent as far as possible penetration
of dust into the workrooms.</p>

<p>Provided that this shall not apply to calcined material from
converters.</p>

<p>Sacks in which lead ores and materials containing lead have
been packed shall not be freed from dust and cleaned except
in a dust-proof apparatus or by washing.</p>

<p>4. Materials containing lead for charging the blast-furnaces,
if they are oxides and form dust, shall be damped before they
are mixed with other materials, stocked on the feeding floor, or
charged into the blast-furnaces.</p>

<p>Provided that this shall not apply in the case of calcined
material from converters.</p>

<p>5. Dust, gases, and lead fumes, escaping from furnaces, and
converters, tapping spouts, tapping pots, drain sump, slag pots,
slag cars, or slag channels, and from glowing residues taken from
the furnaces, shall be caught as near as possible to the point of
origin and removed harmlessly.</p>

<p>Dust collecting chambers, flues, as well as furnaces which
have been ‘blown down,’ shall not be entered by workmen
unless sufficiently cooled and ventilated.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Special Regulations for such parts of a factory where lead colours

<h5>Accumulator Factories</h5>

<p>[Dr. Rambousek gives a very brief synopsis of the German
Imperial Regulations in force for this industry and mentions
that in Great Britain the Regulations of the Secretary of State
dated 1903 are similar. We have printed these, as the code is
fairly representative of the English Regulations for (1) smelting
of metals; (2) paints and colours; (3) tinning of hollow ware;
(4) yarn dyed with chromate of lead; (5) vitreous enamelling;
and the special rules for (6) white lead and (7) earthenware:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Regulations dated November 21, 1903, made by the
Secretary of State for the Manufacture of Electric

Surgeon to be subject to the approval of the Chief Inspector of
Factories.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Medical examination.</i>—Every person employed in a lead
process shall be examined once a month by the Appointed
Surgeon, who shall have power to suspend from employment in
any lead process.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) No person after such suspension shall be employed in a
lead process without written sanction entered in the Health
Register by the Appointed Surgeon. It shall be sufficient compliance
with this regulation for a written certificate to be given
by the Appointed Surgeon and attached to the Health Register,
such certificate to be replaced by a proper entry in the Health
Register at the Appointed Surgeon’s next visit.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Health Register.</i>—A Health Register in a form approved
by the Chief Inspector of Factories shall be kept, and shall contain
a list of all persons employed in lead processes. The
Appointed Surgeon will enter in the Health Register the dates
and results of his examinations of the persons employed and
particulars of any directions given by him. He shall on a
prescribed form furnish to the Chief Inspector of Factories on the
1st day of January in each year a list of the persons suspended by
him during the previous year, the cause and duration of such
suspension, and the number of examinations made.</p>

<p>The Health Register shall be produced at any time when
required by H.M. Inspectors of Factories or by the Certifying
Surgeon or by the Appointed Surgeon.</p>

<p>9. <i>Overalls.</i>—Overalls shall be provided for all persons

<h5>White Lead</h5>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_131">131</a> and <a href="#Page_132">132</a>)</p>

<p>In the manufacture of white lead processes which create
dust are specially dangerous, namely, emptying the corrosion
chambers, drying and grinding, transport of the material
in the form of powder, and packing. The following measures
are called for: emptying the chambers should only be
done by men wearing respirators or equipped with breathing
helmets after preliminary damping of the corrosions by means
of a spray. Use of a vacuum cleaning apparatus suggests
itself. Drying should be done as far as possible in stoves
charged mechanically, the temperature in which can be watched
from the outside; grinding must be done in closed and ventilated
mills; transport of the dried material should be effected by
mechanical means or vacuum apparatus, and packing should
be done in mechanical packing machines. Further, cleanliness
and strict discipline are essential. Alternation of employment
is advisable. The question of substitutes for white lead is
referred to on p. <a href="#Page_293">293</a>.</p>

<p>Manufacture of red lead calls for precisely similar preventive
measures. Charging and emptying the oxidising
furnaces should be done under efficient exhaust ventilation.
Conveyance, sifting, and grinding of the cooled material
requires to be done in the same way as has been described for
white lead.</p>

<p>In the production of chrome colours (lead chromates)
besides the danger from lead the injurious action of chrome has
to be borne in mind.</p>

<p>Regulations for white lead factories have been made in
Germany, Belgium, and Great Britain. We give below the
German Imperial Regulations dated May 26, 1903.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Regulations for Manufacture of Lead Colours and
Lead Products</span></p>

<p>(1) The following regulations apply to all premises in
which lead colours or other chemical lead products (white lead,
chromate of lead, masicot, litharge, minium, peroxide of lead,
Cassel yellow, English yellow, Naples yellow, lead iodide, lead
acetate, &amp;c., are manufactured), or in which mixtures of lead are
prepared as the principal or as a subsidiary business. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
shall not apply to lead smelting works, even though processes
named in paragraph (1) are carried on.</p>

<p>Neither shall they apply to workplaces in which manufactured
colours are intimately mixed or ground in oil or varnish in
connection with another industry.</p>

<p>(2) The workrooms in which the materials mentioned in
paragraph 1 are prepared or packed shall be roomy, lofty, and
so arranged that sufficient and constant exchange of air can take
place.</p>

<p>They shall be provided with a solid and smooth floor
permitting of easy removal of dust by a moist method. The
floor, unless for purposes of manufacture, shall be kept constantly
wet, and shall be wet cleansed at least once daily.</p>

<p>The walls, when not of a smooth washable surface or
painted with oil, shall be whitewashed at least once a year.</p>

<p>(3) The entrance of lead dust, or fumes, into the workrooms
shall be prevented by suitable means as far as possible. Rooms
which cannot be thus protected must be so separated from other
rooms that neither dust nor fumes can enter them.</p>

<p>(4) Lead melting pots shall be covered with a hood and shaft
communicating directly or by a chimney with the open air.</p>

<p>(8)<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> Grinding, sieving, and packing dry lead compounds,
emptying litharge and minium furnaces, and other operations in
which lead dust is generated, shall not be done except under
an exhaust draught, or other efficient means for preventing the
entrance of dust into the workrooms.</p>

<p>In the packing of colours containing only a little lead, in
small amounts, or in small packages for retail purposes, exception
to these regulations can be allowed by the higher authorities.</p>

<p>(9) Machines generating lead dust and not efficiently protected
by their construction or method of use against the escape
of dust, shall have all cracks occluded by means of thick layers
of felt or similar material, so as to prevent the entrance of dust
into the workrooms.</p>

<p>Machines of this kind shall be provided with arrangements
preventing pressure of the air inside. They shall not be opened
until they are cool, and until the dust generated has settled.</p>

<p>(10) Women shall not be employed in factories in which the
colours specified in paragraph (1) are prepared except in work
which does not expose them to the action of lead dust or fumes.
Young persons shall not be employed nor be allowed on
the premises in factories concerned exclusively or in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
part with the preparation of lead colours or other lead
compounds.</p>

<p>(11) No person shall be employed in rooms where the
processes specified in paragraph (1) are carried on who is not
provided with a certificate from a qualified surgeon stating that
he is physically fit and free from disease of the lungs, kidneys,
and stomach, and that he is not addicted to alcohol. This
certificate shall be kept and produced on demand to the Factory
Inspector or Appointed Surgeon.</p>

<p>(12) No person shall be employed in packing lead colours or
mixtures containing lead or other lead compounds in a dry state,
or with the coopering of the filled casks for more than eight hours
daily. This regulation shall not apply where the packing
machines are provided with effectual exhaust arrangements,
or so constructed and used as effectually to prevent the escape
of dust.</p>

<p>No person under 18 years of age shall be employed in the
process mentioned in the above paragraph, but exception can
be allowed in the packing of colours containing lead in small
amount, or in small packages for retail purposes, on application
to the higher authorities.</p>

<p>For the rest, no person coming into contact with lead or lead
compounds shall be employed for more than 10 hours within the
space of 24 hours.</p>

<p>(13) The occupier shall provide overalls and head-coverings
for all persons coming into contact with lead or lead compounds,
and suitable footwear for those emptying the oxidising
chambers.</p>

<p>(14) The occupier shall not allow work involving exposure
to dust to be performed except by workers provided with
respirators or moist sponges covering the nose and mouth.</p>

<p>(15) The occupier shall not allow work involving contact
with soluble salts of lead to be done except by workers provided
with waterproof gloves or by those whose hands have previously
been smeared with vaseline.</p>

<p>(16) The occupier shall provide the overalls, respirators, &amp;c.,
mentioned in paragraphs (13) (14) and (15) for each one of the
workers in sufficient number and in good condition. He shall
take care that they are used only by the workers to whom they
are severally assigned, and that in the intervals of work and
during the time when they are not in use they shall be kept in
their appointed place. Overalls shall be washed every week,
and the respirators, sponges, and gloves before each time that
they are used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>(17) Lavatories and cloak rooms, and, separate from these,
a mess room, shall be provided for the workers coming into
contact with lead or lead compounds in a part of the works free
from dust. These rooms shall be kept in a cleanly condition,
free from dust, and shall be heated during the cold seasons. In
the meal room or in some other suitable place there shall be
means for warming food. The lavatories and cloak rooms shall
be provided with water, vessels for rinsing the mouth, nail
brushes for cleaning the hands and nails, soap, and towels.
Arrangements shall also be made for keeping separate clothes
worn during work from these taken off before the commencement
of work. The occupier shall give facilities for all persons
employed in emptying the oxidizing chambers to have a warm
bath daily after the end of the work, and for those persons
coming into contact with lead or lead compounds, twice weekly.
The time for this shall be during the hours of work, and in the
cold season the bath room, which must be on the factory premises,
shall be heated.</p>

<p>(18) The occupier shall appoint a duly qualified medical
practitioner, whose name shall be sent to the Inspector of
Factories and to the Health Authority. He shall examine the
workers at least twice every month with a view to the
detection of symptoms of lead poisoning. The occupier shall
not employ workers suspected of symptoms of lead poisoning
in occupations exposing them to lead or lead compounds until
they have completely recovered. Those who appear peculiarly

<h5>Use of Lead Colours</h5>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_132">132-4</a>)</p>

<p>As explained on pp. <a href="#Page_132">132-134</a> use of lead in the painting and
varnishing trades frequently causes lead poisoning. This has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
led to regulations in various countries having for their object
partly hygienic measures and partly also limitation of colours
containing lead, such as prohibition of the use of lead paints in
the interior of buildings or in the painting of public buildings
and of ships, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The details of such regulations are seen in the German
Imperial Regulations dated June 27, 1905:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Order of the Imperial Chancellor relating to the
Processes of Painting, Distempering, Whitewashing,
Plastering, or Varnishing. June 27, 1906</span></p>

<p>I.—<i>Regulations for carrying on the Industries of Painting, Distempering,
Whitewashing, Plastering, or Varnishing.</i></p>

<p><i>Regulation 1.</i>—In the processes of crushing, blending,
mixing, and otherwise preparing white lead, other lead colours,
or mixtures thereof with other substances in a dry state, the
workers shall not directly handle pigment containing lead,
and shall be adequately protected against the dust arising
therefrom.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 2.</i>—The process of grinding white lead with oil or
varnish shall not be done by hand, but entirely by mechanical
means, and in vessels so constructed that even in the process of
charging them with white lead no dust shall escape into places
where work is carried on.</p>

<p>This provision shall apply to other lead colours. Provided
that such lead colours may be ground by hand by male workers
over 18 years of age, if not more than one kilogram of red lead
and 100 grains of other lead colours are ground by any one
worker on one day.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 3.</i>—The processes of rubbing-down and pumice-stoning
dry coats of oil-colour or stopping not clearly free from
lead shall not be done except after damping.</p>

<p>All <i>débris</i> produced by rubbing down and pumice-stoning
shall be removed before it becomes dry.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 4.</i>—The employer shall see that every worker who
handles lead colours or mixtures thereof is provided with, and
wears, during working hours, a painter’s overall or other complete
suit of working clothes.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 5.</i>—There shall be provided for all workers engaged
in processes of painting, distempering, whitewashing, plastering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
or varnishing, in which lead colours are used, washing utensils,
nail brushes, soap and towels. If such processes are carried on
in a new building or in a workshop, provision shall be made for
the workers to wash in a place protected from frost, and to store
their clothing in a clean place.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 6.</i>—The employer shall inform workers, who
handle lead colours or mixtures thereof, of the danger to health
to which they are exposed, and shall hand them, at the commencement
of employment, a copy of the accompanying leaflet
(not printed with this edition), if they are not already provided
with it, and also a copy of these Regulations.</p>

<p>II.—<i>Regulations for the Processes of Painting, Distempering,
Whitewashing, Plastering, or Varnishing when carried on
in connection with another Industry.</i></p>

<p><i>Regulation 7.</i>—The provisions of paragraph 6 shall apply to
the employment of workers connected with another industry
who are constantly or principally employed in the processes of
painting, distempering, whitewashing, plastering, or varnishing,
and who use, otherwise than occasionally, lead colours or
mixtures thereof. The provisions of paragraphs 8-11 shall also
apply if such employment is carried on in a factory or shipbuilding
yard.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 8.</i>—Special accommodation for washing and for
dressing shall be provided for the workers, which accommodation
shall be kept clean, heated in cold weather, and furnished
with conveniences for the storage of clothing.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 9.</i>—The employer shall issue regulations which
shall be binding on the workers, and shall contain the following
provisions for such workers as handle lead colour and mixtures
thereof:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Workers shall not consume spirits in any place where work
is carried on.</p>

<p>2. Workers shall not partake of food or drink, or leave the
place of employment until they have put off their
working clothes and carefully washed their hands.</p>

<p>3. Workers, when engaged in processes specified by the
employer, shall wear working clothes.</p>

<p>4. Smoking cigars and cigarettes is prohibited during work.</p>

</div>

<p>Furthermore, it shall be set forth in the regulations that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
workers who, in spite of reiterated warning, contravene the
foregoing provisions may be dismissed before the expiration of
their contract without notice. If a code of regulations has been
issued for the industry (par. 134a of the G.O.) the above indicated
provisions shall be incorporated in the said code.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 10.</i>—The employer shall entrust the supervision
of the workers’ health to a duly qualified medical man approved
of by the public authority, and notified to the factory inspector
(par. 139b of the G.O.), and the said medical man shall examine
the workers once at least in every six months for symptoms
indicative of plumbism.</p>

<p>The employer shall not permit any worker who is suffering
from plumbism or who, in the opinion of the doctor, is suspected
of plumbism, to be employed in any work in which he has to
handle lead colours or mixtures thereof, until he has completely
recovered.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 11.</i>—The employer shall keep or shall cause to be
kept a register in which shall be recorded the state of health of
the workers, and also the constitution of and changes in the staff;
and he shall be responsible for the entries being complete and
accurate, except in so far as they are affected by the medical
man.</p>

<h5>Type Founding and Compositors’ Work</h5>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_138">138</a> and <a href="#Page_139">139</a>)</p>

<p>Fumes which may carry up lead dust are generated in the
casting of letters. Dust arises also in setting the type. General
hygienic measures are especially called for such as healthy
conditions in the workrooms. Much can be done by exhaust
ventilation locally applied to the type cases and to letter (mono-
and linotype) casting machines. Vacuum cleaning of printing
workshops and type cases is strongly advised.</p>

<p>As some lead poisoning in printing works is attributable to
lead colours or bronze powder containing lead their use should
be limited as much as possible.</p>

<p>The German Imperial Regulations for printing works and
type foundries are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Order of the Federal Council of July 31st, 1897,
regulating Letterpress Printing Works and Type
Foundries, in pursuance of Section 120<i>e</i> of the
Industrial Code</span></p>

<p>I. In rooms in which persons are employed in setting up
type or manufacture of type or stereotype plates the following
provisions apply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The floor of workrooms shall not be more than a half a
meter (1·64 feet) below the ground. Exceptions may
only be granted by the higher administrative authority
where hygienic conditions are secured by a dry area, and
ample means of lighting and ventilating the rooms.</p>

<p>Attics may only be used as workrooms if the roof is provided
with a lathe and plaster ceiling.</p>

<p>2. In workrooms in which the manufacture of type or
stereotype plates is carried on, the number of persons
shall not exceed such as would allow at least fifteen
cubic meters of air space (529·5 cubic feet) to each. In
the rooms in which persons are employed only in other
processes, there shall be at least twelve cubic meters of
air space (423·5 cubic feet) to each person.</p>

<p>In cases of exceptional temporary pressure the higher
administrative authority may, on the application of the
employer, permit a larger number in the workrooms, for
at the most 30 days in the year, but not more than will
allow ten cubic meters of air space (353 cubic feet)
for each person.</p>

<p>3. The rooms shall be at least 2·60 meters (8· feet) in
height where a minimum of fifteen cubic meters are
allowed for each person, in other cases at least 3 meters
(9·84 feet) in height.</p>

<p>The rooms shall be provided with windows which are
sufficient in number and size to let in ample light for
every part of the work. The windows shall be so constructed
that they will open and admit of complete
renewal of air in workrooms. Workrooms with sloping
roof shall have an average height equal to the
measurements given in the first paragraph of this
section.</p>

<p>4. The rooms shall be laid with close fitting impervious floor,
which can be cleared of dust by moist methods. Wooden
floors shall be smoothly planed, and boards fitted to
prevent penetration of moisture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
All walls and ceilings shall, if they are not of a smooth
washable surface or painted in oil, be limewashed once
at least a year. If the walls and ceilings are of a smooth
washable surface or painted in oil, they shall be washed
at least once a year, and the oil paint must, if varnished,
be renewed once in ten years, and if not varnished once
in five years.</p>

<p>The compositors’ shelves and stands for type boxes shall
be either closely ranged round the room on the floor, so
that no dust can collect underneath, or be fitted with
legs, so that the floor can be easily cleaned of dust
underneath.</p>

<p>5. The workrooms shall be cleared and thoroughly aired once
at least a day, and during the working hours means shall
be taken to secure constant ventilation.</p>

<p>6. The melting vessel for type or stereotype metal shall be
covered with a hood connected to an exhaust ventilator
or chimney with sufficient draught to draw the fumes
to the outer air.</p>

<p>Type founding and melting may only be carried on in
rooms separate from other processes.</p>

<p>7. The rooms and fittings, particularly the walls, cornices,
and stands for type, shall be thoroughly cleansed twice a
year at least. The floors shall be washed or rubbed over
with a damp cloth, so as to remove dust once a day at
least.</p>

<p>8. The type boxes shall be cleansed before they are put in use,
and again as often as necessary, but not less than twice
at least in the year.</p>

<p>The boxes may only be dusted out with a bellows in the
open air, and this work may not be done by young
persons.</p>

<p>9. In every workroom spittoons filled with water and one at
least for every five persons shall be provided. Workers
are forbidden to spit upon the floor.</p>

<p>10. Sufficient washing appliances, with soap and at least one
towel a week for each worker, shall be provided as near
as possible to the work for compositors, cutters, and
polishers.</p>

<p>One wash-hand basin shall be provided for every five
workers, fitted with an ample supply of water.</p>

<p>The employer shall make strict provision for the use of the
washing appliances by workers before every meal and
before leaving the works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Clothes put off during working hours shall either be kept
outside the workroom or hung up in cupboards with
closely fitting doors or curtains, which are so shut or
drawn as to prevent penetration of dust.</p>

<p>12. Artificial means of lighting which tend to raise the
temperature of the rooms shall be so arranged or
such counteracting measures taken that the heat of the
workrooms shall not be unduly raised.</p>

<p>13. The employer shall draw up rules binding on the workers
which will ensure the full observance of the provisions
in sections 8, 9, 10, and 11.</p>

</div>

<p>II. A notice shall be affixed and a copy sent to the local
police authority shewing:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The length, height, and breadth of the rooms.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The air space in cubic measure.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The number of workers permitted in each room.</p>

<p>A copy of Rules 1 to 13 must be affixed where it can be easily
read by all persons affected.</p>

</div>

<p>III. Provides for the method of permitting the exceptions
named above in sections 2 and 3, and makes it a condition of
reduction in cubic air space for each person employed as type
founder or compositor that there shall be adequate mechanical
ventilation for regulating temperature and carrying off products
of combustion from workrooms.</p>

</div>

<h5>Ceramic Industry</h5>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_135">135-8</a>.)</p>

<p>A complete substitute for lead in glazes seems as yet impossible
on technical grounds, as glaze containing lead has
qualities which cannot be obtained without its use. In small
works the technique necessary for the production of leadless
glazes (special kinds of stoves) cannot be expected, especially
as those carrying on a small industry lack the necessary knowledge
of how to be able to dispense with the use of lead glazes
and substitute leadless materials without complete alteration
in their methods of manufacture. And yet discontinuance or
the utmost possible limitation of the use of lead glazes and
colours is most urgently needed in all small ceramic workshops,
as they are not in a position to put in localised exhaust ventilation,
&amp;c., which is possible in large factories. Observance of
even the simplest hygienic measures can scarcely be obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Consequently very severe cases of lead poisoning are met with
in small works. An effort in the direction of discontinuance
of lead glazes was made in Bohemia, where (at the cost of
the State) technical instruction was given by an expert on the
preparation of leadless glazes especially in districts where the
industry was carried on in the homes of the workers. This
procedure, extension of which is expected, had good results.</p>

<p>Many have demanded, in view of the possibility of substituting
leadless for lead glazes, the total prohibition of lead.
Such is the view of the Dutch inspector De Vooys; Teleky
and Chyzer share the view expressed so far as the small
industry is concerned, since the practicability of the change
has been demonstrated.</p>

<p>English authorities (Thorpe, Oliver) propose diminution
of the lead in the glaze in such a way that on shaking with
weak acid not more than a specified small quantity shall be
dissolved (Thorpe test). In my opinion such a measure is
hardly enough for the small industry. I do not expect much
good from obligatory use of fritted glazes.</p>

<p>In addition to earthenware, manufacture of tiles and
bricks leads not infrequently to cases of lead poisoning from
use of lead glaze.</p>

<p>The following measures apply to the larger ceramic works.
Since risk is considerable, not only in glost placing but also
in grinding, ware-cleaning, &amp;c., closed ball mills in grinding
and locally applied exhaust ventilation in ware-cleaning
operations, &amp;c., must be arranged. Personal cleanliness and
proper equipment of a factory in all the essentials insisted on
on pp. <a href="#Page_226">226-9</a> are important, but nothing can take the place
of efficient locally applied ventilation.</p>

<p>Vitreous enamelling of household utensils, baths, gas stoves,
signs, &amp;c., is an analogous process as enamels containing lead
may be used. Sieving on the dry powder and brushing off
superfluous glaze often cause poisoning. Here generally the
same preventive measures apply.</p>

<p>[In Great Britain the china and earthenware industry is
placed under Regulations dated January 2, 1913, which
supersede the previous Special Rules. These Regulations—thirty-six
in number—provide, among other usual provisions,
(1) for efficient exhaust ventilation in (<i>a</i>) processes giving rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to injurious mineral dust (fettling and pressing of tiles, bedding,
and flinting, brushing and scouring of biscuit) and (<i>b</i>) dusty
lead processes (ware cleaning, aerographing, colour dusting,
litho-transfer making, &amp;c.); and (2) monthly periodical
medical examination of workers in scheduled lead processes.]</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, in consequence of lead poisoning in
porcelain works, committees were appointed to inquire into
the subject in 1901, 1902, and 1903.</p>

<h5>File Cutting</h5>

<p class="center">(See also p. <a href="#Page_140">140</a>)</p>

<p>In file cutting the file is cut on a lead bed or a bed of an
alloy of zinc and lead. The same source of poisoning occurs
in other industries such as amber working. Lead poisoning
among file cutters is pronounced. The best preventive
measure is substitution of a bed of pure zinc for lead. The
German Imperial Health Office have issued a ‘Warning notice’
for file-cutters.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Leaflet for File-cutters</span></p>

<p>The use of lead beds or of alloys of lead with other metals
has repeatedly brought about lead poisoning in file-cutters.
The beds also supposed to be made of zinc usually contain a
considerable proportion of lead, and are thus dangerous to
health.</p>

<p>Among file-cutters lead poisoning arises from absorption of
the metal in small quantities by means of dirty hands, eating,
drinking, smoking or chewing of tobacco. The consequences
of this absorption are not at once noticeable. They appear only
after weeks, months, or even years, according to the extent to
which the lead has accumulated in the system.</p>

<p><i>How does lead poisoning show itself?</i>—The first sign is usually
a bluish-grey line on the gums called the blue line, associated
with anæmia or pallor. Later symptoms are very varied.
Most frequently lead colic comes on, the affected person suffering
from violent cramplike pains starting from the navel; the
stomach is hard and contracted; very often vomiting and
constipation ensue, or, very occasionally, diarrhœa. In some
cases paralysis shows itself—generally in those muscles which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
extend the fingers, usually affecting both arms. In exceptional
cases other muscles of the arms and legs are affected.
Sometimes lead poisoning manifests itself in violent pains in
the joints—generally the knee, more rarely in the shoulder and
elbow. In specially severe cases brain trouble supervenes—violent
headache, convulsions, unconsciousness or blindness.
Finally lead poisoning may set up disease of the kidneys—Bright’s
disease and gout.</p>

<p>Women suffering from lead poisoning frequently miscarry.
Children born alive may, in consequence of lead poisoning,
die in their first year. Children fed at the breast are poisoned
through the milk.</p>

<p>Apart from severe cases complicated with brain trouble,
which are often fatal, persons suffering from lead poisoning
generally recover if they withdraw from further contact.
Recovery takes place after a few weeks, but in severe cases
only after months.</p>

<p>The most effective preventive measures are cleanliness and
temperance. Persons who, without being drunkards, are
accustomed to take spirits in quantity are more likely to
succumb than the abstemious. Spirits should not be taken
during working hours. In regard to cleanliness, file-cutters
using lead beds should be especially careful and observe the
following rules:</p>

<p>1. Since soiling the hands with lead cannot be entirely
avoided, smoking and chewing tobacco during work should be
given up.</p>

<p>2. Workers should only take food and drink or leave the
works after thoroughly washing the hands with soap—if possible
with pumice stone; if drinking during work cannot be wholly
given up the edges of the drinking vessels ought not to be
touched by the hands.</p>

<p>If a file-cutter falls ill in spite of precautions with symptoms
pointing to lead poisoning he should, in his own and his family’s
interest, at once consult a doctor, telling him that he has been
working with a lead bed.</p>

</div>

<h5>Other Industries in which Lead is used</h5>

<p>In cutting <i>precious stones</i> with use of lead discs lead
poisoning frequently occurs, especially where this trade, as
in some parts of Bohemia, is carried on as a home industry.
The authorities have required substitution of carborundum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
(silicon carbide) for lead discs. As, therefore, an efficient
substitute is possible, use of lead should be prohibited.
Similarly, use of lead in the making of musical instruments
should, if possible, be discontinued. Brass pipes in <i>musical
instrument</i> making are filled with lead to facilitate hammering
and bending, and in this way poisoning has occurred. In
numerous other industries where the use of lead cannot be
avoided, and where consequently the danger must be present,
as, for instance, in <i>lead melting</i>, <i>soldering</i>, <i>lead rolling</i>,
<i>stamping</i>, <i>pressing</i>, &amp;c., in the manufacture of <i>lead
piping</i>, <i>shot</i>, <i>wire</i>, <i>bottle capsules</i>, <i>foil</i>, <i>toys</i>, and many other
articles, general preventive measures should be carefully
carried out. <i>Melting of lead</i> and <i>lead alloys</i> should be
carried out only under efficient exhaust ventilation. In larger
works where dust is generated this should be drawn away at
the point where it is produced. This applies also to processes
in the chemical industries where lead or lead compounds are
used, seeing that no substitute is possible.</p>

<h4>Zinc, Brass-casting, Metal Pickling, Galvanising</h4>

<p class="center">(See also pp. <a href="#Page_151">151</a> and <a href="#Page_182">182</a>)</p>

<p>In zinc smelting account has to be taken of fumes which
may contain lead, zinc, arsenic, sulphur dioxide, and carbonic
oxide. Metallic fumes require to be condensed—a procedure
in harmony with economic interests. This is effected
in a technically arranged condensing system, consisting of a
condenser and prolong, in which the fumes are given as large
a space as possible in which to condense and cool. In order
to prevent the entry of fumes into the shed when removing
distillation residues, hoods should be arranged over the front
of the furnace through which the gases can be conducted into
the main chimney stack or be drawn away by a fan; in
addition the residue should fall into trolleys which must either
be covered at once or placed under a closely fitting hood
until the fuming contents are cool. As the mixing of the
materials for charging and the sifting and packing of the
zinc dust (poussière) may cause risk, these processes require
to be carried out mechanically with application of local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
exhaust. Such an arrangement is shown in <a href="#fig59">fig. 59</a> below.
The material which is fed in is carried by the elevator to the
sifting machine, falls into the collecting bin, and is then
packed. The points at which dust can come off are connected
with the exhaust and carried to the dust collector; fans carry
the filtered air to the outside atmosphere.</p>

<p>Only paragraphs 3-8 of the German Imperial Regulations
dated February 6, 1900, for Spelter Works are quoted, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
remainder are on precisely similar lines to those for lead
smelting works given in full on p. <a href="#Page_300">300</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>3. Crushing zinc ore shall not be done except in an apparatus
so arranged as to prevent penetration of dust into the workroom.</p>

<p>4. The roasting furnaces as well as the calcining furnaces
shall be provided with effective exhaust arrangements for the
escaping gases. The occupier shall be responsible for their
efficiency during the time the furnace is at work.</p>

<p>5. To avoid dust, ores intended for charging distillation
furnaces shall not be stacked in front of or charged into the
furnace, or mixed with other material, except in a damp condition.</p>

<p>This regulation shall not apply to large so-called Silesian</p>

<p>Retorts when in use in the zinc smelter; yet in the case of them
also the Higher Authorities may require damping of the charging
material if specially injurious to health.</p>

<p>6. Dust, gases and vapours escaping from distillation
furnaces shall be caught as near as possible to the point of origin
by efficient arrangements and carried out of the smelting rooms.
The entrance of the gases from the fires into the smelting room
shall be prevented as far as possible by suitable arrangements
for drawing them off.</p>

<p>7. Residues shall not be drawn into the smelting room;
they shall be caught in closed channels under the furnaces and
emptied from these channels at once into waggons placed in
passages beneath the distillation rooms.</p>

<p>This regulation (where the Higher Authorities approve)
shall not apply to existing plants, should it be impossible to
make the arrangements mentioned in Reg. 1, or where such
additions could only be added by rebuilding at a prohibitive cost.</p>

<p>8. Sieving and packing of by-products obtained by the
distillation of zinc (poussière, flue dust) shall not be done except
in a special room separate from other workrooms, in accordance
with Reg. 1.</p>

<p>Sieving shall only be done in an apparatus so arranged as to
prevent escape of dust.</p>

</div>

<p>In <i>brass casting</i>, in order to prevent occurrence of brass-founders’
ague, it is necessary that the zinc oxide fumes
evolved should be effectively drawn away from the crucible
by locally applied exhaust ventilation. General ventilation
merely of the room is almost useless, as in casting the fumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
rise up into the face of the pourer. Seeing that casting is
carried on in different parts of the foundry, it is advisable to
connect up the hoods over the moulds by means of metal
piping with the exhaust system, or to arrange a flexible duct
which can be moved about as occasion requires.</p>

<p>Dangerous acid fumes (notably nitrous fumes) are evolved
in metal pickling, especially of brass articles (such as harness
furniture, lamp fittings, church utensils, &amp;c.), for the purpose
of giving them a shiny or dull surface by immersion in baths
of nitric, hydrochloric, or sulphuric acid. As severe and even
fatal poisoning has occurred in these operations they should be
conducted in isolated compartments or channels under exhaust
ventilation. If the ventilation provided is mechanical an acid
proof earthenware fan or an injector is necessary. The following
description applies to one large works: The pickling
troughs are placed in a wooden compartment closed in except
for a small opening in front. To this compartment a stoneware
pipe leading to a stoneware fan is connected. The nitrous
fumes are drawn through the pipe and led into the lower part
of an absorption tower filled with cone-shaped packing material
through which water trickles from a vessel placed at the top.
The greater part of the acid fumes are absorbed as they pass
upwards and the water collects in a receiver below, from which
it is blown by compressed air into the vessel above for utilisation
again until it becomes so charged with acid that it can
be used for pickling purposes.</p>

<p>In <i>galvanising</i> and <i>tinning</i> acid fumes, injurious acroleic
vapour, and metallic fumes can arise as the metal articles
(iron, copper, &amp;c.) first require to be cleaned in an acid bath
and then dipped into molten fat or molten zinc or tin. Here
also the fumes should be drawn away in the manner described.</p>

<h4>Recovery and Use of Mercury</h4>

<p>Escape of mercury vapour and development of sulphur
dioxide seriously endanger workers engaged in smelting
cinnabar. The danger can be minimised by proper construction
of furnaces preventing escape as far as possible of fumes
and most careful condensation of the mercury in impervious
and sufficiently capacious chambers and flues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Continuous furnaces are to be preferred to those working
intermittently. The system of condensing chambers and
flues must offer as long a passage as possible to the fumes, and
care must be taken to keep them thoroughly cool. Removal
of the deposit rich in mercury from the flues is especially
fraught with danger. This work should only be carried on
after efficient watering by workers equipped with respirators,
working suits, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Use of mercury.</i>—Mirror making by coating the glass with
mercury used to be one of the most dangerous occupations.
Now that a fully adequate substitute for mercury has
been found in the nitrate of silver and ammonia process,
use of mercury should be prohibited. As a home industry
especially mirror coating with mercury should be suppressed.
Fortunately the dangerous mode of production is rapidly being
ousted.</p>

<p>The following requirements are contained in a decree of the
Prussian Government dated May 18, 1889:</p>

<p>(1) Medical certificate on admission to employment in
mirror making with use of mercury;</p>

<p>(2) restriction of hours to six in summer and in winter to
eight daily, with a two hours’ mid-day interval;</p>

<p>(3) fortnightly examination of the workers;</p>

<p>(4) air space per person of 40 cubic meters in the coating
room and 30 in the drying room, and, in both, introduction
of 60 cubic meters of air per head per hour;</p>

<p>(5) Work to cease if the temperature of the room in summer
reaches 25° C.</p>

<p>Measures are necessary to prevent occurrence of mercury
poisoning in hatters’ furriers’ processes (preparation of rabbit
fur for felt hats) in consequence of the use of nitrate of mercury.
Danger arises chiefly in cutting the hair, in dressing and drying,
in sorting, and also in the subsequent stages of hard felt hat
manufacture. Aspiration of the dust and fluff at its point of
generation, isolation of the drying rooms and prohibition of
entry into them while drying is going on, are necessary. In
dressing (commonly known as ‘carotting’), the nitric acid
vapour requires to be drawn away. In addition strict personal
hygiene, especially of the teeth, is very important. Processes
involving <i>water gilding</i> (nowadays practised on a very small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
scale) should only be carried on in stoves provided with exhaust
ventilation. Electroplating, fortunately, has almost entirely
taken its place.</p>

<p>As cases of mercury poisoning have been reported from use
of mercurial pumps in producing the vacuum inside <i>electric
incandescent bulbs</i>, air pumps should be substituted for them
whenever possible.</p>

<p><i>Barometer</i> and <i>thermometer</i> makers may and do suffer
severely if care is not taken to draw away the fumes and
ensure good ventilation of the workrooms. Careless handling
and the dropping of mercury on the benches make it difficult
to prevent some volatilisation. Personal hygiene and especially
a proper hygiene of the mouth are of the greatest importance in
this class of work.</p>

<p>Preparation of mercury compounds in chemical factories,
especially the dry processes (sublimation), as in production of
cinnabar, corrosive sublimate and calomel mixing, grinding,
and sublimation, require to be carried on in closed apparatus.
Preparation of the substances named above in solution involves
much less risk than subliming. From our point of view,
therefore, the former is to preferred.</p>

<h4>Arsenic, Arsenic Compounds, Arseniuretted Hydrogen</h4>

<p>For arsenic works imperviousness of the system and as
complete condensation as possible are necessary to prevent
escape of fumes.</p>

<p>Respirators should be worn in manipulations with white
arsenic, and such work as packing done under conditions of
locally applied exhaust ventilation.</p>

<p>Industrial use of arsenic compounds, in view of the risk
attaching to them, should be reduced as much as possible.
This has sometimes been achieved by technical improvement
in processes of manufacture. Thus in the colour industry, where
formerly colours containing arsenic played an important rôle,
coal-tar colours have taken their place, and use of arsenic
even in these (as in the manufacture of fuchsin) has been
replaced by nitrobenzene.</p>

<p>As the danger from arseniuretted hydrogen gas is especially
great in processes in which acid acts on metal and either one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
or both of them contain arsenic, the materials, should be as
free from arsenic as possible, in the production, for example,
of hydrogen for soldering, in extracting metals by means of
acids, in galvanic elements, in accumulator works, in the
storage and transport of acids in metal vessels, and in
galvanising.</p>

<p>In any case the workers in these industries should be
warned of the danger and instructed in case of emergencies.
For soldering exclusive use of hydrogen produced electrolytically
and procurable in steel cylinders is advisable.</p>

<h4>Extraction and Use of Gold and Silver</h4>

<p>In the extraction of gold and silver by amalgamation and
subsequent volatilisation of mercury there is risk of mercurial
poisoning. The preventive measures necessary are similar to
those for poisoning in the recovery of mercury (see p. <a href="#Page_327">327</a>).</p>

<p><i>Argyria</i> in pearl bead blowers can be avoided by using
pumps to blow the silver solution into the beads instead of the
mouth.</p>

<p>In electroplating the possibility of poisonous fumes arising
from the baths must be guarded against because hydrocyanic
(prussic) acid, though only in minute quantities, may be
evolved; care must be taken that the workrooms are well
ventilated or the baths hooded. Careful personal hygiene is
essential, for the prevention of skin diseases from which
workers in electroplating often suffer.</p>

<h3 id="OTHER_TRADES">VII<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN OTHER TRADES</i></span></h3>

<h4>Ceramic Industry</h4>

<p>In the glass industry use of lead, chrome, and arsenic
compounds should be restricted as much as possible or allowed
only under suitable precautions (exhaust ventilation, personal
hygiene, &amp;c.).</p>

<p><i>Etching on glass</i> by means of hydrofluoric causes almost
inevitably injury to the workers. Rendering the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
glass opaque should preferably be done by sand blast. When
a bath of hydrofluoric acid for etching on glass is used the
fumes require to be drawn away by hoods over the baths
and the work-rooms well ventilated.</p>

<p>Further precautionary measures are called for in view of
industrial poisoning by furnace gases in various ceramic
industries, as, for example, cement works, glass works, and
tile works.</p>

<p>The following suggestions are made in the technical introduction
to the Germany Factory Act for prevention of poisoning
from carbonic oxide, carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide:</p>

<p>(1) Even the fixing of benches which might be used for
sleeping on near the furnaces should be strictly forbidden;</p>

<p>(2) All furnaces which are roofed over should be provided
with adequate side and roof ventilation;</p>

<p>(3) All gas pipes and cocks must be maintained in an
impervious condition.</p>

<h4>Manufacture and Use of Varnishes and Drying Oils</h4>

<p>Unpleasant fumes are given off on boiling linseed oil with
oxidising substances, which should be prevented by closely
fitting covers and condensation of the fumes in cooling apparatus.
In heating and dissolving resin for the production of
varnishes the fumes evolved require to be dealt with in a
similar way.</p>

<p>Preventive measures must be taken also in the use of
quick-drying paints on ships and inside steam boilers as, owing
to the rapid evaporation of the poisonous solvents—benzene,
benzine and turpentine—fatalities have occurred. As a result
of elaborate investigation by the inspectors of factories in
Hamburg the following instructions were issued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Quick-drying paint for ships and for preventing rust should
only be used under the supervision of a person conversant with
the danger to health and risk from fire.</p>

<p>They should only be allowed for the painting of interior
surfaces after adoption of adequate precautions—free ventilation,
use of smoke helmets with air conducting apparatus, and no
naked lights, &amp;c. Since use of quick-drying paints cannot
easily be prohibited and the fumes from the substitutes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
turpentine—benzene and other light tarry oils—exert injurious
effect on man, precautionary measures are called for. Regulation
of working hours is as important as provision of
adequate ventilation. Workers, therefore, should be allowed
proper intervals from work.</p>

<p>Confined spaces in the interior of ships should be adequately
ventilated before, after, and during work; all persons
who use the paints should have opportunity for washing given
them at their work places, and should be compelled to avail
themselves of these facilities; indulgence in alcohol and smoking
should be prohibited; receptacles in which quick-drying paints
are sold should be provided with an air-tight cover and with a
warning notice as to the danger of the contents.</p>

<p>Paints made from petroleum fractions of low boiling-point,
light coal-tar oils, turpentine oil, carbon bisulphide, and
similar substances, are to be regarded as injurious to health.</p>

<p>Persons under eighteen, and women, should not be allowed
to work with quick-drying paints.</p>

<p>Obligatory notification of cases of poisoning by hydrocarbons
and other similar poisonings would have a good effect.</p>

</div>

<p>Schaefer (Inspector of Factories in Hamburg) has drawn
up the following leaflet for painters, varnishers, workers in
dry docks, and others engaged in painting with quick drying
paints and oils:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>All quick-drying paints and oils are more or less injurious
to health and very inflammable, as they contain volatile substances
such as benzine (naphtha, petrol ether), benzene, turpentine
oil, carbon bisulphide, &amp;c. These paints are mostly
used in painting interiors of ships, boilers, machinery, apparatus,
&amp;c., and come on the market under various names, such as
Black Varnish Oil, Solution, Patent Colour, Anti-corrosive,
Dermatin, Acid-proof Paint, Apexior, Saxol, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Even at ordinary temperatures the volatile fluids used as
mediums for dry paint powders, or as a first coating, evaporate.
Air filled with the fumes is not only harmful to health, but
liable to explosion. Working with these paints and oils in the
interior of ships, or steam boilers and the like, has repeatedly
led to explosions and fatal poisoning.</p>

<p><i>Danger of Poisoning.</i>—All persons are exposed to the danger
of poisoning who use quick-drying paints in the interior of
rooms or receptacles, or otherwise manipulate the paints. The
warmer the room and the less ventilation there is before and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
during the painting, the greater the danger of poisoning. On
the other hand, use of these paints in the open air is generally
without effect.</p>

<p>Poisoning arises from inhaling the fumes of hydrocarbons.
The symptoms are oppression, headache, inclination to vomit,
cough, hiccough, giddiness, noises in the ears, drunken-like
excitement, trembling and twitching. Inhalation of larger
quantities brings on, quite suddenly and without previous
warning, unconsciousness, which may last many hours and is
often fatal. Except in severe cases the symptoms generally
soon disappear, if the affected person withdraws from further
contact with the fumes. The most effective protection therefore
against poisoning is fresh air and temperance. In so far
as painting with quick-drying materials is necessary in workrooms,
interiors of ships, water and ballast tanks, double bottoms,
bunkers, bilges, cabins, boilers and receptacles, care must be
taken to ensure thorough ventilation before, after, and while
the work is going on. Where no sufficient ventilation is possible
these paints ought not to be used. Frequent intermission of
work by a short stay in the open air is useful. When working
in spaces not easily accessible, the worker should be roped.</p>

<p>Speaking, singing, or whistling during work favours inhalation
of the fumes and is, therefore, to be avoided. Indulgence
in spirits, especially during working hours, increases the danger
of poisoning. Habitual drinkers should not be allowed to work
at all with quick-drying paints and oils.</p>

<p>At the first signs of discomfort work should be stopped.
An immediate stay in the open air will then usually dispel the
poisonous symptoms.</p>

<p>If, notwithstanding this, severe symptoms develop, oxygen
inhalation should be commenced forthwith and medical aid
called in.</p>

</div>

<h4>Production of Vegetable Foods and Luxuries</h4>

<p class="center">(See also p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>)</p>

<p>Measures for the prevention of industrial poisoning have to
be thought of in connection with drying processes (by smoke
gases, carbon dioxide, and carbonic oxide), many processes
of preserving (use of sulphur dioxide, &amp;c.), and fermentation
(accumulation of carbonic acid).</p>

<p>In breweries the use of kilns allowing fire gases to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
enter the drying-rooms formerly caused carbonic oxide and
carbonic acid poisoning. The general introduction of hot
air kilns provided with mechanical malt-turning apparatus
should be insisted on, and is in keeping with progress in technical
methods.</p>

<p>The accumulation of carbonic acid in the malting cellars
can be prevented in the same way as in a distillery.</p>

<p>If ammonia is used for <i>refrigeration</i>, precautions are
necessary so that, in the event of leakage or bursting of pipes,
the workers may escape. Naturally the imperviousness of
the freezing system must be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Oppression and danger to the health of the workers is
occasionally caused by the development of gases in the coating
of barrels with pitch, partly preventable by the use of pitching
machines.</p>

<p>In the production of <i>spirits</i> carbonic acid poisoning can
occur from accumulation of carbonic acid in the fermentation
cellars. These should be thoroughly ventilated and in view
of the heaviness of the gas, openings for ventilation should
always be located at the floor level.</p>

<p>In the <i>sulphuring of malt</i> the following recommendations
were made by the Austrian inspectors:</p>

<p>During the sulphuring process the room ought not to be
entered (for the turning over of the malt). When the sulphur
has been burnt, the drying-room must be ventilated from the
outside, by opening the windows and letting in cold currents
of air, until the sulphur dioxide has completely dispersed,
which can be tested by holding a strip of moistened blue
litmus paper at the half-opened door. If it does not turn
red, turning over of the malt may be proceeded with.</p>

<p>As the <i>sulphuring of hops</i> in hop districts is done in primitive
little kilns, in which the hops are spread out on a kind of gridiron
and sulphur burnt below in iron pans, development of sulphur
dioxide may affect the workers. The following regulations are
therefore suggested for work in these kilns:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The rooms in which sulphuring takes place must be airtight,
capable of being locked, and provided with arrangements which
make it possible to remove the sulphur dioxide fumes before
the room is entered. This can usually be done by a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
coke fire, maintained in the chimney place, which creates the
necessary draught. If fans are used, it must be remembered
that iron is affected and destroyed by acid gases; stoneware
fans are therefore advisable.</p>

</div>

<p>In the production of <i>vinegar</i>, air escapes laden with acetic
acid vapour, alcohol, lower oxidation products of alcohol,
aldehyde, acetic ether, &amp;c. Their escape can be avoided if
the whole process is carried on in a closed self-acting apparatus
with the advantage also that no loss occurs.</p>

<p>In premises for <i>drying agricultural products</i> (fruit, chicory,
turnips) the persons employed in the drying-room are exposed
to the danger of carbonic oxide poisoning from direct firing.</p>

<p>The following recommendations for work in drying-rooms
with direct firing are taken from an Austrian decree of 1901:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The lower drying chambers, in which the real drying process
is effected, should be so arranged that the objects dried in them
can be removed by means of long-handled implements through
a passage shut off from the drying-room. The separation of
this passage can be effected by loose tin plates which can be
removed as required for the work of turning or removal of the
dried products, so that the worker need not come into contact
with the gases.</p>

<p>Open fires should be so arranged that if required they can
be shut off, by simple arrangements, from the drying-rooms
in which the workers are temporarily occupied in carrying in,
and turning, the objects to be dried, transferring the partly
dried products to hotter hurdles, and emptying them when
finished, in such a way that the entrance of combustion gases
into the drying chambers can be completely prevented. In
order, however, to prevent a back draught, arrangements must
be made for simultaneous removal of the gases by pipes
connected with a chimney or smoke flue. The places from
which the fires are charged should, in addition, be furnished
with suitably arranged openings for ventilation leading into
the outer air, in order to neutralise, in case of need, any back
draught from the furnaces into the rooms.</p>

<p>The windows of the drying chambers should be so arranged
as to open both from within and without.</p>

<p>The floor of the roof space, or attic, which forms at the same
time the ceiling of the upper drying-room, should be kept
perfectly airtight, as also the openings into it through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the steam pipes pass. For this purpose the floor should be a
double one and the openings or boxes into which material is
thrown should have a double cover above and below. Further,
situated in the highest point of the ceiling of the roof space,
there should be a suitable number of openings topped by
louvred turrets. In the roof space no work should be done
except manipulations necessary for the charging of the hurdles
with the goods to be dried. Use of the roof floor as a sleeping
or living room is not permissible.</p>

<p>Before the workers enter the drying chambers for the purpose
of turning the materials, the stove should be shut off, the gases
drawn from the furnace into the chimney or flue, and at the
same time the doors and windows of the drying rooms opened.</p>

<p>Entering of drying chambers for working purposes should
only be done after a sufficient time has elapsed for removal of
the air by ventilation.</p>

<p>Charging of the furnaces should be so arranged that they
burn as low as possible before the removal of the dried
materials and before subsequent work in the drying chambers.
Seeing that chicory and turnip drying is done intermittently
by night, a special sleeping or waiting room with free ventilation
should be provided. The regulations concerning the ventilation
of the workrooms are to be made known to the workers.</p>

</div>

<h4>Cigar Industry</h4>

<p>In order to prevent injury to health to tobacco workers
the dust and fumes, especially at cutting and sifting machines,
require to be drawn away by locally applied exhaust ventilation.
The workrooms, moreover, must conform to hygienic
requirements, especially as to cleanliness. Washing accommodation
and baths are desirable, but are only likely to be
provided in large works.</p>

<h4>Wood Working</h4>

<p class="center">(See also p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>)</p>

<p>Risk from poisonous woods can be avoided by exhaust
ventilation applied to the wood-working machinery.</p>

<p>To lessen the danger to health in the use of methylated
spirits in the polishing of wood adequate ventilation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
workrooms is necessary; drawing off the fumes by local
ventilation is often impossible.</p>

<h4>Production of Wood-pulp (Cellulose) and Paper.</h4>

<p>In the <i>sulphite cellulose</i> process, sulphur dioxide may
escape from the sulphur stoves or from the boilers; escape
of sulphur dioxide is also possible through defective gas pipes
and condensers. Gas pipes and condensers require to be
quite impervious and condensation or absorption as complete
as possible. The fumes escaping from the boilers should
be led through pipes into closed boilers for condensation
purposes; the gases not condensed here are to be led into
absorption towers.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of <i>paper</i> with use of chloride of lime
for bleaching chlorine can be given off in considerable quantity,
requiring removal of the gases from the apparatus.</p>

<p>The use of poisonous colours containing lead or arsenic,
and addition of lead-containing substances to the paper pulp,
is now very rare.</p>

<h4>Textile Industries.</h4>

<p class="center">(See also p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>)</p>

<p>In the textile industry only a few manipulations are associated
with serious risk of poisoning. Those engaged in
carbonising are exposed to acid fumes; closed and ventilated
apparatus, therefore, as far as possible, require to be used
and the acid gases escaping from them should be absorbed.
These requirements are fulfilled by carbonising stoves which
are ventilated and connected with coke condensers. It is
especially urged that only arsenic free acid be employed, as
otherwise danger of poisoning by arseniuretted hydrogen may
be incurred.</p>

<p>In the making of <i>artificial silk</i>, according to the Chardonnet-Cadoret
process, the precautionary measures recommended in
nitrating together with careful exhaustion of the ether and
camphor fumes apply.</p>

<p>The combustion gases (containing carbonic oxide) developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
in the process of singeing are harmful and require
to be led away at their source.</p>

<p>Poisonous metallic salts, especially lead and lead-containing
zinc, are used as weighting materials, in dressing or
finishing, and sometimes cause symptoms among the workers.
Apart from the danger to those occupied in spinning and
weaving, the workers who handle these products (in the
clothing trade) also run a risk from lead.</p>

<p>Precautionary measures are necessary in the <i>varnishing of
woven materials</i>, as the substances employed may contain
volatile poisonous solvents. If these poisonous solvents
cannot be replaced by others less poisonous, carefully applied
exhaust ventilation must be provided. The same holds good
when carbon bisulphide, benzene, and benzine are used as
solvents in the production of woven materials impregnated
with indiarubber.</p>

<p>Employment of lead salts and other poisonous metallic
salts in the glossing of woven materials, or in order to render
them non-inflammable, is to be deprecated.</p>

<p>Cases of lead poisoning have occurred in the working-up
of asbestos, as lead wire is sometimes used in the process
of weaving.</p>

<p>To protect workers in <i>chlorine</i> and <i>sulphur bleaching</i> from
poisoning by chlorine or sulphur dioxide the gases arising
from the bleaching liquids should be drawn away. Use
of closed bleaching apparatus, as is the case in large
works, reduces the danger to a minimum. Bleaching-rooms
should be connected with a powerful stoneware fan, so that
they may be thoroughly aired before they are entered.</p>

<h4>Dye Works</h4>

<p>Industrial poisoning by dyes is, in general, rare, as the
natural dyes (wood and tar dyes) are almost without
exception non-poisonous. Further, the dyes are generally
only used in diluted solution. Formerly the arsenic in many
tar dyes caused poisoning, but now it is usually the
mordants which have harmful effect. To this class belong
chromic acid salts and mordants containing arsenic, antimony
(tartar-emetic), and also chloride of tin. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
scraping off of layers of paint containing arsenic, arsenic
dust may arise. In Turkey red dyeworks, especially sodium
arsenite is used for fixing the tar dyes.</p>

<p>Orpiment dyes which may give off poisonous arseniuretted
hydrogen gas are becoming less and less used; from the
point of view of industrial hygiene, the utmost possible
avoidance of the use of arsenic-containing preparations in
dye works is to be recommended. Where this is not possible,
strict personal hygiene must be enforced (as, for instance,
application of vaseline to the skin).</p>

are:</p>

<p>1. Ferro-silicon should not be sent out from the works immediately after
manufacture, but after being broken up into pieces of the size in which it is usually
sold, should be stored under cover, but exposed to the air as completely as possible,
for at least a month before being despatched from the works.</p>

<p>2. Manufacturers should be required to mark in bold letters each barrel or other
parcel of ferro-silicon with the name and percentage grade (certified by chemical
analysis) of the material; the name of the works where it is produced; the date of
manufacture; and date of despatch.</p>

<p>3. The carriage of ferro-silicon on vessels carrying passengers should be prohibited.
When carried on cargo boats it should, if circumstances permit, be stored
on deck. If it be considered necessary to store it elsewhere, the place of storage
should be capable of being adequately ventilated, and such place of storage should
be cut off by airtight bulkheads from the quarters occupied by the crew of the
vessel.</p>

<p>4. This regulation should apply to the transport of ferro-silicon on river or
canal barges as well as on sea-going vessels.</p>

<p>5. Storage places at docks or at works where ferro-silicon is used should have
provision for free access of air, and should be situated at a distance from work-rooms,
mess-rooms, offices, &amp;c.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
